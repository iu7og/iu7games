It was Ser Jorah Mormont who answered. Take the reins and ride. You need not go far.
  Nervously Dany gathered the reins in her hands and slid her feet into the short stirrups. She was only a fair rider; she had spent far more time traveling by ship and wagon and palanquin than by horseback. Praying that she would not fall off and disgrace herself, she gave the filly the lightest and most timid touch with her knees.
  And for the first time in hours, she forgot to be afraid. Or perhaps it was for the first time ever.
  The silver-grey filly moved with a smooth and silken gait, and the crowd parted for her, every eye upon them. Dany found herself moving faster than she had intended, yet somehow it was exciting rather than terrifying. The horse broke into a trot, and she smiled. Dothraki scrambled to clear a path. The slightest pressure with her legs, the lightest touch on the reins, and the filly responded. She sent it into a gallop, and now the Dothraki were hooting and laughing and shouting at her as they jumped out of her way. As she turned to ride back, a firepit loomed ahead, directly in her path. They were hemmed in on either side, with no room to stop. A daring she had never known filled Daenerys then, and she gave the filly her head.
  The silver horse leapt the flames as if she had wings.
  When she pulled up before Magister Illyrio, she said, Tell Khal Drogo that he has given me the wind. The fat Pentoshi stroked his yellow beard as he repeated her words in Dothraki, and Dany saw her new husband smile for the first time.
  The last sliver of sun vanished behind the high walls of Pentos to the west just then. Dany had lost all track of time. Khal Drogo commanded his bloodriders to bring forth his own horse, a lean red stallion. As the khal was saddling the horse, Viserys slid close to Dany on her silver, dug his fingers into her leg, and said, Please him, sweet sister, or I swear, you will see the dragon wake as it has never woken before.
  The fear came back to her then, with her brothers words. She felt like a child once more, only thirteen and all alone, not ready for what was about to happen to her.
  They rode out together as the stars came out, leaving the khalasar and the grass palaces behind. Khal Drogo spoke no word to her, but drove his stallion at a hard trot through the gathering dusk. The tiny silver bells in his long braid rang softly as he rode. I am the blood of the dragon, she whispered aloud as she followed, trying to keep her courage up. I am the blood of the dragon. I am the blood of the dragon. The dragon was never afraid.
  Afterward she could not say how far or how long they had ridden, but it was full dark when they stopped at a grassy place beside a small stream. Drogo swung off his horse and lifted her down from hers. She felt as fragile as glass in his hands, her limbs as weak as water. She stood there helpless and trembling in her wedding silks while he secured the horses, and when he turned to look at her, she began to cry.
  Khal Drogo stared at her tears, his face strangely empty of expression. No, he said. He lifted his hand and rubbed away the tears roughly with a callused thumb.
  You speak the Common Tongue, Dany said in wonder.
  No, he said again.
  Perhaps he had only that word, she thought, but it was one word more than she had known he had, and somehow it made her feel a little better. Drogo touched her hair lightly, sliding the silver-blond strands between his fingers and murmuring softly in Dothraki. Dany did not understand the words, yet there was warmth in the tone, a tenderness she had never expected from this man.
  He put his finger under her chin and lifted her head, so she was looking up into his eyes. Drogo towered over her as he towered over everyone. Taking her lightly under the arms, he lifted her and seated her on a rounded rock beside the stream. Then he sat on the ground facing her, legs crossed beneath him, their faces finally at a height. No, he said.
  Is that the only word you know? she asked him.
  Drogo did not reply. His long heavy braid was coiled in the dirt beside him. He pulled it over his right shoulder and began to remove the bells from his hair, one by one. After a moment Dany leaned forward to help. When they were done, Drogo gestured. She understood. Slowly, carefully, she began to undo his braid.
  It took a long time. All the while he sat there silently, watching her. When she was done, he shook his head, and his hair spread out behind him like a river of darkness, oiled and gleaming. She had never seen hair so long, so black, so thick.
  Then it was his turn. He began to undress her.
  His fingers were deft and strangely tender. He removed her silks one by one, carefully, while Dany sat unmoving, silent, looking at his eyes. When he bared her small breasts, she could not help herself. She averted her eyes and covered herself with her hands. No, Drogo said. He pulled her hands away from her breasts, gently but firmly, then lifted her face again to make her look at him. No, he repeated.
  No, she echoed back at him.
  He stood her up then and pulled her close to remove the last of her silks. The night air was chilly on her bare skin. She shivered, and gooseflesh covered her arms and legs. She was afraid of what would come next, but for a while nothing happened. Khal Drogo sat with his legs crossed, looking at her, drinking in her body with his eyes.
  After a while he began to touch her. Lightly at first, then harder. She could sense the fierce strength in his hands, but he never hurt her. He held her hand in his own and brushed her fingers, one by one. He ran a hand gently down her leg. He stroked her face, tracing the curve of her ears, running a finger gently around her mouth. He put both hands in her hair and combed it with his fingers. He turned her around, massaged her shoulders, slid a knuckle down the path of her spine.
  It seemed as if hours passed before his hands finally went to her breasts. He stroked the soft skin underneath until it tingled. He circled her nipples with his thumbs, pinched them between thumb and forefinger, then began to pull at her, very lightly at first, then more insistently, until her nipples stiffened and began to ache.
  He stopped then, and drew her down onto his lap. Dany was flushed and breathless, her heart fluttering in her chest. He cupped her face in his huge hands and looked into his eyes. No? he said, and she knew it was a question.
  She took his hand and moved it down to the wetness between her thighs. Yes, she whispered as she put his finger inside her.
 Eddard
  The summons came in the hour before the dawn, when the world was still and grey.
  Alyn shook him roughly from his dreams and Ned stumbled into the predawn chill, groggy from sleep, to find his horse saddled and the king already mounted. Robert wore thick brown gloves and a heavy fur cloak with a hood that covered his ears, and looked for all the world like a bear sitting a horse. Up, Stark! he roared. Up, up! We have matters of state to discuss.
  By all means, Ned said. Come inside, Your Grace. Alyn lifted the flap of the tent.
  No, no, no, Robert said. His breath steamed with every word. The camp is full of ears. Besides, I want to ride out and taste this country of yours. Ser Boros and Ser Meryn waited behind him with a dozen guardsmen, Ned saw. There was nothing to do but rub the sleep from his eyes, dress, and mount up.
  Robert set the pace, driving his huge black destrier hard as Ned galloped along beside him, trying to keep up. He called out a question as they rode, but the wind blew his words away, and the king did not hear him. After that Ned rode in silence. They soon left the kingsroad and took off across rolling plains dark with mist. By then the guard had fallen back a small distance, safely out of earshot, but still Robert would not slow.
  Dawn broke as they crested a low ridge, and finally the king pulled up. By then they were miles south of the main party. Robert was flushed and exhilarated as Ned reined up beside him. Gods, he swore, laughing, it feels good to get out and ride the way a man was meant to ride! I swear, Ned, this creeping along is enough to drive a man mad. He had never been a patient man, Robert Baratheon. That damnable wheelhouse, the way it creaks and groans, climbing every bump in the road as if it were a mountain I promise you, if that wretched thing breaks another axle, Im going to burn it, and Cersei can walk!
  Ned laughed. I will gladly light the torch for you.
  Good man! The king clapped him on the shoulder. Ive half a mind to leave them all behind and just keep going.
  A smile touched Neds lips. I do believe you mean it.
  I do, I do, the king said. What do you say, Ned? Just you and me, two vagabond knights on the kingsroad, our swords at our sides and the gods know what in front of us, and maybe a farmers daughter or a tavern wench to warm our beds tonight.
  Would that we could, Ned said, but we have duties now, my liege to the realm, to our children, I to my lady wife and you to your queen. We are not the boys we were.
  You were never the boy you were, Robert grumbled. Mores the pity. And yet there was that one time what was her name, that common girl of yours? Becca? No, she was one of mine, gods love her, black hair and these sweet big eyes, you could drown in them. Yours was Aleena? No. You told me once. Was it Merryl? You know the one I mean, your bastards mother?
  Her name was Wylla, Ned replied with cool courtesy, and I would sooner not speak of her.
  Wylla. Yes. The king grinned. She must have been a rare wench if she could make Lord Eddard Stark forget his honor, even for an hour. You never told me what she looked like
  Neds mouth tightened in anger. Nor will I. Leave it be, Robert, for the love you say you bear me. I dishonored myself and I dishonored Catelyn, in the sight of gods and men.
  Gods have mercy, you scarcely knew Catelyn.
  I had taken her to wife. She was carrying my child.
  You are too hard on yourself, Ned. You always were. Damn it, no woman wants Baelor the Blessed in her bed. He slapped a hand on his knee. Well, Ill not press you if you feel so strong about it, though I swear, at times youre so prickly you ought to take the hedgehog as your sigil.
  The rising sun sent fingers of light through the pale white mists of dawn. A wide plain spread out beneath them, bare and brown, its flatness here and there relieved by long, low hummocks. Ned pointed them out to his king. The barrows of the First Men.
  Robert frowned. Have we ridden onto a graveyard?
  There are barrows everywhere in the north, Your Grace, Ned told him. This land is old.
  And cold, Robert grumbled, pulling his cloak more tightly around himself. The guard had reined up well behind them, at the bottom of the ridge. Well, I did not bring you out here to talk of graves or bicker about your bastard. There was a rider in the night, from Lord Varys in Kings Landing. Here. The king pulled a paper from his belt and handed it to Ned.
  Varys the eunuch was the kings master of whisperers. He served Robert now as he had once served Aerys Targaryen. Ned unrolled the paper with trepidation, thinking of Lysa and her terrible accusation, but the message did not concern Lady Arryn. What is the source for this information?
  Do you remember Ser Jorah Mormont?
  Would that I might forget him, Ned said bluntly. The Mormonts of Bear Island were an old house, proud and honorable, but their lands were cold and distant and poor. Ser Jorah had tried to swell the family coffers by selling some poachers to a Tyroshi slaver. As the Mormonts were bannermen to the Starks, his crime had dishonored the north. Ned had made the long journey west to Bear Island, only to find when he arrived that Jorah had taken ship beyond the reach of Ice and the kings justice. Five years had passed since then.
  Ser Jorah is now in Pentos, anxious to earn a royal pardon that would allow him to return from exile, Robert explained. Lord Varys makes good use of him.
  So the slaver has become a spy, Ned said with distaste. He handed the letter back. I would rather he become a corpse.
  Varys tells me that spies are more useful than corpses, Robert said. Jorah aside, what do you make of his report?
  Daenerys Targaryen has wed some Dothraki horselord. What of it? Shall we send her a wedding gift?
  The king frowned. A knife, perhaps. A good sharp one, and a bold man to wield it.
  Ned did not feign surprise; Roberts hatred of the Targaryens was a madness in him. He remembered the angry words they had exchanged when Tywin Lannister had presented Robert with the corpses of Rhaegars wife and children as a token of fealty. Ned had named that murder; Robert called it war. When he had protested that the young prince and princess were no more than babes, his new-made king had replied, I see no babes. Only dragonspawn. Not even Jon Arryn had been able to calm that storm. Eddard Stark had ridden out that very day in a cold rage, to fight the last battles of the war alone in the south. It had taken another death to reconcile them; Lyannas death, and the grief they had shared over her passing.
  This time, Ned resolved to keep his temper. Your Grace, the girl is scarcely more than a child. You are no Tywin Lannister, to slaughter innocents. It was said that Rhaegars little girl had cried as they dragged her from beneath her bed to face the swords. The boy had been no more than a babe in arms, yet Lord Tywins soldiers had torn him from his mothers breast and dashed his head against a wall.
  And how long will this one remain an innocent? Roberts mouth grew hard. This child will soon enough spread her legs and start breeding more dragonspawn to plague me.
  Nonetheless, Ned said, the murder of children it would be vile unspeakable
  Unspeakable? the king roared. What Aerys did to your brother Brandon was unspeakable. The way your lord father died, that was unspeakable. And Rhaegar how many times do you think he raped your sister? How many hundreds of times? His voice had grown so loud that his horse whinnied nervously beneath him. The king jerked the reins hard, quieting the animal, and pointed an angry finger at Ned. I will kill every Targaryen I can get my hands on, until they are as dead as their dragons, and then I will piss on their graves.
  Ned knew better than to defy him when the wrath was on him. If the years had not quenched Roberts thirst for revenge, no words of his would help. You cant get your hands on this one, can you? he said quietly.
  The kings mouth twisted in a bitter grimace. No, gods be cursed. Some pox-ridden Pentoshi cheesemonger had her brother and her walled up on his estate with pointy-hatted eunuchs all around them, and now hes handed them over to the Dothraki. I should have had them both killed years ago, when it was easy to get at them, but Jon was as bad as you. More fool I, I listened to him.
  Jon Arryn was a wise man and a good Hand.
  Robert snorted. The anger was leaving him as suddenly as it had come. This Khal Drogo is said to have a hundred thousand men in his horde. What would Jon say to that?
  He would say that even a million Dothraki are no threat to the realm, so long as they remain on the other side of the narrow sea, Ned replied calmly. The barbarians have no ships. They hate and fear the open sea.
  The king shifted uncomfortably in his saddle. Perhaps. There are ships to be had in the Free Cities, though. I tell you, Ned, I do not like this marriage. There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms who call me Usurper. Do you forget how many houses fought for Targaryen in the war? They bide their time for now, but give them half a chance, they will murder me in my bed, and my sons with me. If the beggar king crosses with a Dothraki horde at his back, the traitors will join him.
  He will not cross, Ned promised. And if by some mischance he does, we will throw him back into the sea. Once you choose a new Warden of the East
  The king groaned. For the last time, I will not name the Arryn boy Warden. I know the boy is your nephew, but with Targaryens climbing in bed with Dothraki, I would be mad to rest one quarter of the realm on the shoulders of a sickly child.
  Ned was ready for that. Yet we still must have a Warden of the East. If Robert Arryn will not do, name one of your brothers. Stannis proved himself at the siege of Storms End, surely.
  He let the name hang there for a moment. The king frowned and said nothing. He looked uncomfortable.
  That is, Ned finished quietly, watching, unless you have already promised the honor to another.
  For a moment Robert had the grace to look startled. Just as quickly, the look became annoyance. What if I have?
  Its Jaime Lannister, is it not?
  Robert kicked his horse back into motion and started down the ridge toward the barrows. Ned kept pace with him. The king rode on, eyes straight ahead. Yes, he said at last. A single hard word to end the matter.
  Kingslayer, Ned said. The rumors were true, then. He rode on dangerous ground now, he knew. An able and courageous man, no doubt, he said carefully, but his father is Warden of the West, Robert. In time Ser Jaime will succeed to that honor. No one man should hold both East and West. He left unsaid his real concern; that the appointment would put half the armies of the realm into the hands of Lannisters.
  I will fight that battle when the enemy appears on the field, the king said stubbornly. At the moment, Lord Tywin looms eternal as Casterly Rock, so I doubt that Jaime will be succeeding anytime soon. Dont vex me about this, Ned, the stone has been set.
  Your Grace, may I speak frankly?
  I seem unable to stop you, Robert grumbled. They rode through tall brown grasses.
  Can you trust Jaime Lannister?
  He is my wifes twin, a Sworn Brother of the Kingsguard, his life and fortune and honor all bound to mine.
  As they were bound to Aerys Targaryens, Ned pointed out.
  Why should I mistrust him? He has done everything I have ever asked of him. His sword helped win the throne I sit on.
  His sword helped taint the throne you sit on, Ned thought, but he did not permit the words to pass his lips. He swore a vow to protect his kings life with his own. Then he opened that kings throat with a sword.
  Seven hells, someone had to kill Aerys! Robert said, reining his mount to a sudden halt beside an ancient barrow. If Jaime hadnt done it, it would have been left for you or me.
  We were not Sworn Brothers of the Kingsguard, Ned said. The time had come for Robert to hear the whole truth, he decided then and there. Do you remember the Trident, Your Grace?
  I won my crown there. How should I forget it?
  You took a wound from Rhaegar, Ned reminded him. So when the Targaryen host broke and ran, you gave the pursuit into my hands. The remnants of Rhaegars army fled back to Kings Landing. We followed. Aerys was in the Red Keep with several thousand loyalists. I expected to find the gates closed to us.
  Robert gave an impatient shake of his head. Instead you found that our men had already taken the city. What of it?
  Not our men, Ned said patiently. Lannister men. The lion of Lannister flew over the ramparts, not the crowned stag. And they had taken the city by treachery.
  The war had raged for close to a year. Lords great and small had flocked to Roberts banners; others had remained loyal to Targaryen. The mighty Lannisters of Casterly Rock, the Wardens of the West, had remained aloof from the struggle, ignoring calls to arms from both rebels and royalists. Aerys Targaryen must have thought that his gods had answered his prayers when Lord Tywin Lannister appeared before the gates of Kings Landing with an army twelve thousand strong, professing loyalty. So the mad king had ordered his last mad act. He had opened his city to the lions at the gate.
  Treachery was a coin the Targaryens knew well, Robert said. The anger was building in him again. Lannister paid them back in kind. It was no less than they deserved. I shall not trouble my sleep over it.
  You were not there, Ned said, bitterness in his voice. Troubled sleep was no stranger to him. He had lived his lies for fourteen years, yet they still haunted him at night. There was no honor in that conquest.
  The Others take your honor! Robert swore. What did any Targaryen ever know of honor? Go down into your crypt and ask Lyanna about the dragons honor!
  You avenged Lyanna at the Trident, Ned said, halting beside the king. Promise me, Ned, she had whispered.
  That did not bring her back. Robert looked away, off into the grey distance. The gods be damned. It was a hollow victory they gave me. A crown it was the girl I prayed them for. Your sister, safe and mine again, as she was meant to be. I ask you, Ned, what good is it to wear a crown? The gods mock the prayers of kings and cowherds alike.
  I cannot answer for the gods, Your Grace only for what I found when I rode into the throne room that day, Ned said. Aerys was dead on the floor, drowned in his own blood. His dragon skulls stared down from the walls. Lannisters men were everywhere. Jaime wore the white cloak of the Kingsguard over his golden armor. I can see him still. Even his sword was gilded. He was seated on the Iron Throne, high above his knights, wearing a helm fashioned in the shape of a lions head. How he glittered!
  This is well known, the king complained.
  I was still mounted. I rode the length of the hall in silence, between the long rows of dragon skulls. It felt as though they were watching me, somehow. I stopped in front of the throne, looking up at him. His golden sword was across his legs, its edge red with a kings blood. My men were filling the room behind me. Lannisters men drew back. I never said a word. I looked at him seated there on the throne, and I waited. At last Jaime laughed and got up. He took off his helm, and he said to me, Have no fear, Stark. I was only keeping it warm for our friend Robert. Its not a very comfortable seat, Im afraid.
  The king threw back his head and roared. His laughter startled a flight of crows from the tall brown grass. They took to the air in a wild beating of wings. You think I should mistrust Lannister because he sat on my throne for a few moments? He shook with laughter again. Jaime was all of seventeen, Ned. Scarce more than a boy.
  Boy or man, he had no right to that throne.
  Perhaps he was tired, Robert suggested. Killing kings is weary work. Gods know, theres no place else to rest your ass in that damnable room. And he spoke truly, it is a monstrous uncomfortable chair. In more ways than one. The king shook his head. Well, now I know Jaimes dark sin, and the matter can be forgotten. I am heartily sick of secrets and squabbles and matters of state, Ned. Its all as tedious as counting coppers. Come, lets ride, you used to know how. I want to feel the wind in my hair again. He kicked his horse back into motion and galloped up over the barrow, raining earth down behind him.
  For a moment Ned did not follow. He had run out of words, and he was filled with a vast sense of helplessness. Not for the first time, he wondered what he was doing here and why he had come. He was no Jon Arryn, to curb the wildness of his king and teach him wisdom. Robert would do what he pleased, as he always had, and nothing Ned could say or do would change that. He belonged in Winterfell. He belonged with Catelyn in her grief, and with Bran.
  A man could not always be where he belonged, though. Resigned, Eddard Stark put his boots into his horse and set off after the king.
 Tyrion
  The north went on forever.
  Tyrion Lannister knew the maps as well as anyone, but a fortnight on the wild track that passed for the kingsroad up here had brought home the lesson that the map was one thing and the land quite another.
  They had left Winterfell on the same day as the king, amidst all the commotion of the royal departure, riding out to the sound of men shouting and horses snorting, to the rattle of wagons and the groaning of the queens huge wheelhouse, as a light snow flurried about them. The kingsroad was just beyond the sprawl of castle and town. There the banners and the wagons and the columns of knights and freeriders turned south, taking the tumult with them, while Tyrion turned north with Benjen Stark and his nephew.
  It had grown colder after that, and far more quiet.
  West of the road were flint hills, grey and rugged, with tall watchtowers on their stony summits. To the east the land was lower, the ground flattening to a rolling plain that stretched away as far as the eye could see. Stone bridges spanned swift, narrow rivers, while small farms spread in rings around holdfasts walled in wood and stone. The road was well trafficked, and at night for their comfort there were rude inns to be found.
  Three days ride from Winterfell, however, the farmland gave way to dense wood, and the kingsroad grew lonely. The flint hills rose higher and wilder with each passing mile, until by the fifth day they had turned into mountains, cold blue-grey giants with jagged promontories and snow on their shoulders. When the wind blew from the north, long plumes of ice crystals flew from the high peaks like banners.
  With the mountains a wall to the west, the road veered north by northeast through the wood, a forest of oak and evergreen and black brier that seemed older and darker than any Tyrion had ever seen. The wolfswood, Benjen Stark called it, and indeed their nights came alive with the howls of distant packs, and some not so distant. Jon Snows albino direwolf pricked up his ears at the nightly howling, but never raised his own voice in reply. There was something very unsettling about that animal, Tyrion thought.
  There were eight in the party by then, not counting the wolf. Tyrion traveled with two of his own men, as befit a Lannister. Benjen Stark had only his bastard nephew and some fresh mounts for the Nights Watch, but at the edge of the wolfswood they stayed a night behind the wooden walls of a forest holdfast, and there joined up with another of the black brothers, one Yoren. Yoren was stooped and sinister, his features hidden behind a beard as black as his clothing, but he seemed as tough as an old root and as hard as stone. With him were a pair of ragged peasant boys from the Fingers. Rapers, Yoren said with a cold look at his charges. Tyrion understood. Life on the Wall was said to be hard, but no doubt it was preferable to castration.
  Five men, three boys, a direwolf, twenty horses, and a cage of ravens given over to Benjen Stark by Maester Luwin. No doubt they made a curious fellowship for the kingsroad, or any road.
  Tyrion noticed Jon Snow watching Yoren and his sullen companions, with an odd cast to his face that looked uncomfortably like dismay. Yoren had a twisted shoulder and a sour smell, his hair and beard were matted and greasy and full of lice, his clothing old, patched, and seldom washed. His two young recruits smelled even worse, and seemed as stupid as they were cruel.
  No doubt the boy had made the mistake of thinking that the Nights Watch was made up of men like his uncle. If so, Yoren and his companions were a rude awakening. Tyrion felt sorry for the boy. He had chosen a hard life or perhaps he should say that a hard life had been chosen for him.
  He had rather less sympathy for the uncle. Benjen Stark seemed to share his brothers distaste for Lannisters, and he had not been pleased when Tyrion had told him of his intentions. I warn you, Lannister, youll find no inns at the Wall, he had said, looking down on him.
  No doubt youll find some place to put me, Tyrion had replied. As you might have noticed, Im small.
  One did not say no to the queens brother, of course, so that had settled the matter, but Stark had not been happy. You will not like the ride, I promise you that, hed said curtly, and since the moment they set out, he had done all he could to live up to that promise.
  By the end of the first week, Tyrions thighs were raw from hard riding, his legs were cramping badly, and he was chilled to the bone. He did not complain. He was damned if he would give Benjen Stark that satisfaction.
  He took a small revenge in the matter of his riding fur, a tattered bearskin, old and musty-smelling. Stark had offered it to him in an excess of Nights Watch gallantry, no doubt expecting him to graciously decline. Tyrion had accepted with a smile. He had brought his warmest clothing with him when they rode out of Winterfell, and soon discovered that it was nowhere near warm enough. It was cold up here, and growing colder. The nights were well below freezing now, and when the wind blew it was like a knife cutting right through his warmest woolens. By now Stark was no doubt regretting his chivalrous impulse. Perhaps he had learned a lesson. The Lannisters never declined, graciously or otherwise. The Lannisters took what was offered.
  Farms and holdfasts grew scarcer and smaller as they pressed northward, ever deeper into the darkness of the wolfswood, until finally there were no more roofs to shelter under, and they were thrown back on their own resources.
  Tyrion was never much use in making a camp or breaking one. Too small, too hobbled, too in-the-way. So while Stark and Yoren and the other men erected rude shelters, tended the horses, and built a fire, it became his custom to take his fur and a wineskin and go off by himself to read.
  On the eighteenth night of their journey, the wine was a rare sweet amber from the Summer Isles that he had brought all the way north from Casterly Rock, and the book a rumination on the history and properties of dragons. With Lord Eddard Starks permission, Tyrion had borrowed a few rare volumes from the Winterfell library and packed them for the ride north.
  He found a comfortable spot just beyond the noise of the camp, beside a swift-running stream with waters clear and cold as ice. A grotesquely ancient oak provided shelter from the biting wind. Tyrion curled up in his fur with his back against the trunk, took a sip of the wine, and began to read about the properties of dragonbone. Dragonbone is black because of its high iron content, the book told him. It is strong as steel, yet lighter and far more flexible, and of course utterly impervious to fire. Dragonbone bows are greatly prized by the Dothraki, and small wonder. An archer so armed can outrange any wooden bow.
  Tyrion had a morbid fascination with dragons. When he had first come to Kings Landing for his sisters wedding to Robert Baratheon, he had made it a point to seek out the dragon skulls that had hung on the walls of Targaryens throne room. King Robert had replaced them with banners and tapestries, but Tyrion had persisted until he found the skulls in the dank cellar where they had been stored.
  He had expected to find them impressive, perhaps even frightening. He had not thought to find them beautiful. Yet they were. As black as onyx, polished smooth, so the bone seemed to shimmer in the light of his torch. They liked the fire, he sensed. Hed thrust the torch into the mouth of one of the larger skulls and made the shadows leap and dance on the wall behind him. The teeth were long, curving knives of black diamond. The flame of the torch was nothing to them; they had bathed in the heat of far greater fires. When he had moved away, Tyrion could have sworn that the beasts empty eye sockets had watched him go.
