Catelyn touched his arm. We are here, Ser Rodrik, and safely. That is all that truly matters. Her hand groped beneath her cloak, her fingers stiff and fumbling. The dagger was still at her side. She found she had to touch it now and then, to reassure herself. Now we must reach the kings master-at-arms, and pray that he can be trusted.
  Ser Aron Santagar is a vain man, but an honest one. Ser Rodriks hand went to his face to stroke his whiskers and discovered once again that they were gone. He looked nonplussed. He may know the blade, yes but, my lady, the moment we go ashore we are at risk. And there are those at court who will know you on sight.
  Catelyns mouth grew tight. Littlefinger, she murmured. His face swam up before her; a boys face, though he was a boy no longer. His father had died several years before, so he was Lord Baelish now, yet still they called him Littlefinger. Her brother Edmure had given him that name, long ago at Riverrun. His familys modest holdings were on the smallest of the Fingers, and Petyr had been slight and short for his age.
  Ser Rodrik cleared his throat. Lord Baelish once, ah His thought trailed off uncertainly in search of the polite word.
  Catelyn was past delicacy. He was my fathers ward. We grew up together in Riverrun. I thought of him as a brother, but his feelings for me were more than brotherly. When it was announced that I was to wed Brandon Stark, Petyr challenged for the right to my hand. It was madness. Brandon was twenty, Petyr scarcely fifteen. I had to beg Brandon to spare Petyrs life. He let him off with a scar. Afterward my father sent him away. I have not seen him since. She lifted her face to the spray, as if the brisk wind could blow the memories away. He wrote to me at Riverrun after Brandon was killed, but I burned the letter unread. By then I knew that Ned would marry me in his brothers place.
  Ser Rodriks fingers fumbled once again for nonexistent whiskers. Littlefinger sits on the small council now.
  I knew he would rise high, Catelyn said. He was always clever, even as a boy, but it is one thing to be clever and another to be wise. I wonder what the years have done to him.
  High overhead, the far-eyes sang out from the rigging. Captain Moreo came scrambling across the deck, giving orders, and all around them the Storm Dancer burst into frenetic activity as Kings Landing slid into view atop its three high hills.
  Three hundred years ago, Catelyn knew, those heights had been covered with forest, and only a handful of fisherfolk had lived on the north shore of the Blackwater Rush where that deep, swift river flowed into the sea. Then Aegon the Conqueror had sailed from Dragonstone. It was here that his army had put ashore, and there on the highest hill that he built his first crude redoubt of wood and earth.
  Now the city covered the shore as far as Catelyn could see; manses and arbors and granaries, brick storehouses and timbered inns and merchants stalls, taverns and graveyards and brothels, all piled one on another. She could hear the clamor of the fish market even at this distance. Between the buildings were broad roads lined with trees, wandering crookback streets, and alleys so narrow that two men could not walk abreast. Visenyas hill was crowned by the Great Sept of Baelor with its seven crystal towers. Across the city on the hill of Rhaenys stood the blackened walls of the Dragonpit, its huge dome collapsing into ruin, its bronze doors closed now for a century. The Street of the Sisters ran between them, straight as an arrow. The city walls rose in the distance, high and strong.
  A hundred quays lined the waterfront, and the harbor was crowded with ships. Deepwater fishing boats and river runners came and went, ferrymen poled back and forth across the Blackwater Rush, trading galleys unloaded goods from Braavos and Pentos and Lys. Catelyn spied the queens ornate barge, tied up beside a fat-bellied whaler from the Port of Ibben, its hull black with tar, while upriver a dozen lean golden warships rested in their cribs, sails furled and cruel iron rams lapping at the water.
  And above it all, frowning down from Aegons high hill, was the Red Keep; seven huge drum-towers crowned with iron ramparts, an immense grim barbican, vaulted halls and covered bridges, barracks and dungeons and granaries, massive curtain walls studded with archers nests, all fashioned of pale red stone. Aegon the Conqueror had commanded it built. His son Maegor the Cruel had seen it completed. Afterward he had taken the heads of every stonemason, woodworker, and builder who had labored on it. Only the blood of the dragon would ever know the secrets of the fortress the Dragonlords had built, he vowed.
  Yet now the banners that flew from its battlements were golden, not black, and where the three-headed dragon had once breathed fire, now pranced the crowned stag of House Baratheon.
  A high-masted swan ship from the Summer Isles was beating out from port, its white sails huge with wind. The Storm Dancer moved past it, pulling steadily for shore.
  My lady, Ser Rodrik said, I have thought on how best to proceed while I lay abed. You must not enter the castle. I will go in your stead and bring Ser Aron to you in some safe place.
  She studied the old knight as the galley drew near to a pier. Moreo was shouting in the vulgar Valyrian of the Free Cities. You would be as much at risk as I would.
  Ser Rodrik smiled. I think not. I looked at my reflection in the water earlier and scarcely recognized myself. My mother was the last person to see me without whiskers, and she is forty years dead. I believe I am safe enough, my lady.
  Moreo bellowed a command. As one, sixty oars lifted from the river, then reversed and backed water. The galley slowed. Another shout. The oars slid back inside the hull. As they thumped against the dock, Tyroshi seamen leapt down to tie up. Moreo came bustling up, all smiles. Kings Landing, my lady, as you did command, and never has a ship made a swifter or surer passage. Will you be needing assistance to carry your things to the castle?
  We shall not be going to the castle. Perhaps you can suggest an inn, someplace clean and comfortable and not too far from the river.
  The Tyroshi fingered his forked green beard. Just so. I know of several establishments that might suit your needs. Yet first, if I may be so bold, there is the matter of the second half of the payment we agreed upon. And of course the extra silver you were so kind as to promise. Sixty stags, I believe it was.
  For the oarmen, Catelyn reminded him.
  Oh, of a certainty, said Moreo. Though perhaps I should hold it for them until we return to Tyrosh. For the sake of their wives and children. If you give them the silver here, my lady, they will dice it away or spend it all for a nights pleasure.
  There are worse things to spend money on, Ser Rodrik put in. Winter is coming.
  A man must make his own choices, Catelyn said. They earned the silver. How they spend it is no concern of mine.
  As you say, my lady, Moreo replied, bowing and smiling.
  Just to be sure, Catelyn paid the oarmen herself, a stag to each man, and a copper to the two men who carried their chests halfway up Visenyas hill to the inn that Moreo had suggested. It was a rambling old place on Eel Alley. The woman who owned it was a sour crone with a wandering eye who looked them over suspiciously and bit the coin that Catelyn offered her to make sure it was real. Her rooms were large and airy, though, and Moreo swore that her fish stew was the most savory in all the Seven Kingdoms. Best of all, she had no interest in their names.
  I think it best if you stay away from the common room, Ser Rodrik said, after they had settled in. Even in a place like this, one never knows who may be watching. He wore ringmail, dagger, and longsword under a dark cloak with a hood he could pull up over his head. I will be back before nightfall, with Ser Aron, he promised. Rest now, my lady.
  Catelyn was tired. The voyage had been long and fatiguing, and she was no longer as young as she had been. Her windows opened on the alley and rooftops, with a view of the Blackwater beyond. She watched Ser Rodrik set off, striding briskly through the busy streets until he was lost in the crowds, then decided to take his advice. The bedding was stuffed with straw instead of feathers, but she had no trouble falling asleep.
  She woke to a pounding on her door.
  Catelyn sat up sharply. Outside the window, the rooftops of Kings Landing were red in the light of the setting sun. She had slept longer than she intended. A fist hammered at her door again, and a voice called out, Open, in the name of the king.
  A moment, she called out. She wrapped herself in her cloak. The dagger was on the bedside table. She snatched it up before she unlatched the heavy wooden door.
  The men who pushed into the room wore the black ringmail and golden cloaks of the City Watch. Their leader smiled at the dagger in her hand and said, No need for that, mlady. Were to escort you to the castle.
  By whose authority? she said.
  He showed her a ribbon. Catelyn felt her breath catch in her throat. The seal was a mockingbird, in grey wax. Petyr, she said. So soon. Something must have happened to Ser Rodrik. She looked at the head guardsman. Do you know who I am?
  No, mlady, he said. Mlord Littlefinger said only to bring you to him, and see that you were not mistreated.
  Catelyn nodded. You may wait outside while I dress.
  She bathed her hands in the basin and wrapped them in clean linen. Her fingers were thick and awkward as she struggled to lace up her bodice and knot a drab brown cloak about her neck. How could Littlefinger have known she was here? Ser Rodrik would never have told him. Old he might be, but he was stubborn, and loyal to a fault. Were they too late, had the Lannisters reached Kings Landing before her? No, if that were true, Ned would be here too, and surely he would have come to her. How?
  Then she thought, Moreo. The Tyroshi knew who they were and where they were, damn him. She hoped hed gotten a good price for the information.
  They had brought a horse for her. The lamps were being lit along the streets as they set out, and Catelyn felt the eyes of the city on her as she rode, surrounded by the guard in their golden cloaks. When they reached the Red Keep, the portcullis was down and the great gates sealed for the night, but the castle windows were alive with flickering lights. The guardsmen left their mounts outside the walls and escorted her through a narrow postern door, then up endless steps to a tower.
  He was alone in the room, seated at a heavy wooden table, an oil lamp beside him as he wrote. When they ushered her inside, he set down his pen and looked at her. Cat, he said quietly.
  Why have I been brought here in this fashion?
  He rose and gestured brusquely to the guards. Leave us. The men departed. You were not mistreated, I trust, he said after they had gone. I gave firm instructions. He noticed her bandages. Your hands
  Catelyn ignored the implied question. I am not accustomed to being summoned like a serving wench, she said icily. As a boy, you still knew the meaning of courtesy.
  Ive angered you, my lady. That was never my intent. He looked contrite. The look brought back vivid memories for Catelyn. He had been a sly child, but after his mischiefs he always looked contrite; it was a gift he had. The years had not changed him much. Petyr had been a small boy, and he had grown into a small man, an inch or two shorter than Catelyn, slender and quick, with the sharp features she remembered and the same laughing grey-green eyes. He had a little pointed chin beard now, and threads of silver in his dark hair, though he was still shy of thirty. They went well with the silver mockingbird that fastened his cloak. Even as a child, he had always loved his silver.
  How did you know I was in the city? she asked him.
  Lord Varys knows all, Petyr said with a sly smile. He will be joining us shortly, but I wanted to see you alone first. It has been too long, Cat. How many years?
  Catelyn ignored his familiarity. There were more important questions. So it was the Kings Spider who found me.
  Littlefinger winced. You dont want to call him that. Hes very sensitive. Comes of being an eunuch, I imagine. Nothing happens in this city without Varys knowing. Oftimes he knows about it before it happens. He has informants everywhere. His little birds, he calls them. One of his little birds heard about your visit. Thankfully, Varys came to me first.
  Why you?
  He shrugged. Why not me? I am master of coin, the kings own councillor. Selmy and Lord Renly rode north to meet Robert, and Lord Stannis is gone to Dragonstone, leaving only Maester Pycelle and me. I was the obvious choice. I was ever a friend to your sister Lysa, Varys knows that.
  Does Varys know about
  Lord Varys knows everything except why you are here. He lifted an eyebrow. Why are you here?
  A wife is allowed to yearn for her husband, and if a mother needs her daughters close, who can tell her no?
  Littlefinger laughed. Oh, very good, my lady, but please dont expect me to believe that. I know you too well. What were the Tully words again?
  Her throat was dry. Family, Duty, Honor, she recited stiffly. He did know her too well.
  Family, Duty, Honor, he echoed. All of which required you to remain in Winterfell, where our Hand left you. No, my lady, something has happened. This sudden trip of yours bespeaks a certain urgency. I beg of you, let me help. Old sweet friends should never hesitate to rely upon each other. There was a soft knock on the door. Enter, Littlefinger called out.
  The man who stepped through the door was plump, perfumed, powdered, and as hairless as an egg. He wore a vest of woven gold thread over a loose gown of purple silk, and on his feet were pointed slippers of soft velvet. Lady Stark, he said, taking her hand in both of his, to see you again after so many years is such a joy. His flesh was soft and moist, and his breath smelled of lilacs. Oh, your poor hands. Have you burned yourself, sweet lady? The fingers are so delicate Our good Maester Pycelle makes a marvelous salve, shall I send for a jar?
  Catelyn slid her fingers from his grasp. I thank you, my lord, but my own Maester Luwin has already seen to my hurts.
  Varys bobbed his head. I was grievous sad to hear about your son. And him so young. The gods are cruel.
  On that we agree, Lord Varys, she said. The title was but a courtesy due him as a council member; Varys was lord of nothing but the spiderweb, the master of none but his whisperers.
  The eunuch spread his soft hands. On more than that, I hope, sweet lady. I have great esteem for your husband, our new Hand, and I know we do both love King Robert.
  Yes, she was forced to say. For a certainty.
  Never has a king been so beloved as our Robert, quipped Littlefinger. He smiled slyly. At least in Lord Varyss hearing.
  Good lady, Varys said with great solicitude. There are men in the Free Cities with wondrous healing powers. Say only the word, and I will send for one for your dear Bran.
  Maester Luwin is doing all that can be done for Bran, she told him. She would not speak of Bran, not here, not with these men. She trusted Littlefinger only a little, and Varys not at all. She would not let them see her grief. Lord Baelish tells me that I have you to thank for bringing me here.
  Varys giggled like a little girl. Oh, yes. I suppose I am guilty. I hope you forgive me, kind lady. He eased himself down into a seat and put his hands together. I wonder if we might trouble you to show us the dagger?
  Catelyn Stark stared at the eunuch in stunned disbelief. He was a spider, she thought wildly, an enchanter or worse. He knew things no one could possibly know, unlessWhat have you done to Ser Rodrik? she demanded.
  Littlefinger was lost. I feel rather like the knight who arrives at the battle without his lance. What dagger are we talking about? Who is Ser Rodrik?
  Ser Rodrik Cassel is master-at-arms at Winterfell, Varys informed him. I assure you, Lady Stark, nothing at all has been done to the good knight. He did call here early this afternoon. He visited with Ser Aron Santagar in the armory, and they talked of a certain dagger. About sunset, they left the castle together and walked to that dreadful hovel where you were staying. They are still there, drinking in the common room, waiting for your return. Ser Rodrik was very distressed to find you gone.
  How could you know all that?
  The whisperings of little birds, Varys said, smiling. I know things, sweet lady. That is the nature of my service. He shrugged. You do have the dagger with you, yes?
  Catelyn pulled it out from beneath her cloak and threw it down on the table in front of him. Here. Perhaps your little birds will whisper the name of the man it belongs to.
  Varys lifted the knife with exaggerated delicacy and ran a thumb along its edge. Blood welled, and he let out a squeal and dropped the dagger back on the table.
  Careful, Catelyn told him, its sharp.
  Nothing holds an edge like Valyrian steel, Littlefinger said as Varys sucked at his bleeding thumb and looked at Catelyn with sullen admonition. Littlefinger hefted the knife lightly in his hand, testing the grip. He flipped it in the air, caught it again with his other hand. Such sweet balance. You want to find the owner, is that the reason for this visit? You have no need of Ser Aron for that, my lady. You should have come to me.
  And if I had, she said, what would you have told me?
  I would have told you that there was only one knife like this at Kings Landing. He grasped the blade between thumb and forefinger, drew it back over his shoulder, and threw it across the room with a practiced flick of his wrist. It struck the door and buried itself deep in the oak, quivering. Its mine.
  Yours? It made no sense. Petyr had not been at Winterfell.
  Until the tourney on Prince Joffreys name day, he said, crossing the room to wrench the dagger from the wood. I backed Ser Jaime in the jousting, along with half the court. Petyrs sheepish grin made him look half a boy again. When Loras Tyrell unhorsed him, many of us became a trifle poorer. Ser Jaime lost a hundred golden dragons, the queen lost an emerald pendant, and I lost my knife. Her Grace got the emerald back, but the winner kept the rest.
  Who? Catelyn demanded, her mouth dry with fear. Her fingers ached with remembered pain.
  The Imp, said Littlefinger as Lord Varys watched her face. Tyrion Lannister.
 Jon
  The courtyard rang to the song of swords.
  Under black wool, boiled leather, and mail, sweat trickled icily down Jons chest as he pressed the attack. Grenn stumbled backward, defending himself clumsily. When he raised his sword, Jon went underneath it with a sweeping blow that crunched against the back of the other boys leg and sent him staggering. Grenns downcut was answered by an overhand that dented his helm. When he tried a sideswing, Jon swept aside his blade and slammed a mailed forearm into his chest. Grenn lost his footing and sat down hard in the snow. Jon knocked his sword from his fingers with a slash to his wrist that brought a cry of pain.
  Enough! Ser Alliser Thorne had a voice with an edge like Valyrian steel.
  Grenn cradled his hand. The bastard broke my wrist.
  The bastard hamstrung you, opened your empty skull, and cut off your hand. Or would have, if these blades had an edge. Its fortunate for you that the Watch needs stableboys as well as rangers. Ser Alliser gestured at Jeren and Toad. Get the Aurochs on his feet, he has funeral arrangements to make.
  Jon took off his helm as the other boys were pulling Grenn to his feet. The frosty morning air felt good on his face. He leaned on his sword, drew a deep breath, and allowed himself a moment to savor the victory.
  That is a longsword, not an old mans cane, Ser Alliser said sharply. Are your legs hurting, Lord Snow?
  Jon hated that name, a mockery that Ser Alliser had hung on him the first day he came to practice. The boys had picked it up, and now he heard it everywhere. He slid the longsword back into its scabbard. No, he replied.
  Thorne strode toward him, crisp black leathers whispering faintly as he moved. He was a compact man of fifty years, spare and hard, with grey in his black hair and eyes like chips of onyx. The truth now, he commanded.
  Im tired, Jon admitted. His arm burned from the weight of the longsword, and he was starting to feel his bruises now that the fight was done.
  What you are is weak.
  I won.
  No. The Aurochs lost.
  One of the other boys sniggered. Jon knew better than to reply. He had beaten everyone that Ser Alliser had sent against him, yet it gained him nothing. The master-at-arms served up only derision. Thorne hated him, Jon had decided; of course, he hated the other boys even worse.
  That will be all, Thorne told them. I can only stomach so much ineptitude in any one day. If the Others ever come for us, I pray they have archers, because you lot are fit for nothing more than arrow fodder.
  Jon followed the rest back to the armory, walking alone. He often walked alone here. There were almost twenty in the group he trained with, yet not one he could call a friend. Most were two or three years his senior, yet not one was half the fighter Robb had been at fourteen. Dareon was quick but afraid of being hit. Pyp used his sword like a dagger, Jeren was weak as a girl, Grenn slow and clumsy. Halders blows were brutally hard but he ran right into your attacks. The more time he spent with them, the more Jon despised them.
  Inside, Jon hung sword and scabbard from a hook in the stone wall, ignoring the others around him. Methodically, he began to strip off his mail, leather, and sweat-soaked woolens. Chunks of coal burned in iron braziers at either end of the long room, but Jon found himself shivering. The chill was always with him here. In a few years he would forget what it felt like to be warm.
  The weariness came on him suddenly, as he donned the roughspun blacks that were their everyday wear. He sat on a bench, his fingers fumbling with the fastenings on his cloak. So cold, he thought, remembering the warm halls of Winterfell, where the hot waters ran through the walls like blood through a mans body. There was scant warmth to be found in Castle Black; the walls were cold here, and the people colder.
  No one had told him the Nights Watch would be like this; no one except Tyrion Lannister. The dwarf had given him the truth on the road north, but by then it had been too late. Jon wondered if his father had known what the Wall would be like. He must have, he thought; that only made it hurt the worse.
  Even his uncle had abandoned him in this cold place at the end of the world. Up here, the genial Benjen Stark he had known became a different person. He was First Ranger, and he spent his days and nights with Lord Commander Mormont and Maester Aemon and the other high officers, while Jon was given over to the less than tender charge of Ser Alliser Thorne.
  Three days after their arrival, Jon had heard that Benjen Stark was to lead a half-dozen men on a ranging into the haunted forest. That night he sought out his uncle in the great timbered common hall and pleaded to go with him. Benjen refused him curtly. This is not Winterfell, he told him as he cut his meat with fork and dagger. On the Wall, a man gets only what he earns. Youre no ranger, Jon, only a green boy with the smell of summer still on you.
  Stupidly, Jon argued. Ill be fifteen on my name day, he said. Almost a man grown.
  Benjen Stark frowned. A boy you are, and a boy youll remain until Ser Alliser says you are fit to be a man of the Nights Watch. If you thought your Stark blood would win you easy favors, you were wrong. We put aside our old families when we swear our vows. Your father will always have a place in my heart, but these are my brothers now. He gestured with his dagger at the men around them, all the hard cold men in black.
  Jon rose at dawn the next day to watch his uncle leave. One of his rangers, a big ugly man, sang a bawdy song as he saddled his garron, his breath steaming in the cold morning air. Ben Stark smiled at that, but he had no smile for his nephew. How often must I tell you no, Jon? Well speak when I return.
  As he watched his uncle lead his horse into the tunnel, Jon had remembered the things that Tyrion Lannister told him on the kingsroad, and in his minds eye he saw Ben Stark lying dead, his blood red on the snow. The thought made him sick. What was he becoming?
  Afterward he sought out Ghost in the loneliness of his cell, and buried his face in his thick white fur.
  If he must be alone, he would make solitude his armor. Castle Black had no godswood, only a small sept and a drunken septon, but Jon could not find it in him to pray to any gods, old or new. If they were real, he thought, they were as cruel and implacable as winter.
  He missed his true brothers: little Rickon, bright eyes shining as he begged for a sweet; Robb, his rival and best friend and constant companion; Bran, stubborn and curious, always wanting to follow and join in whatever Jon and Robb were doing. He missed the girls too, even Sansa, who never called him anything but my half brother since she was old enough to understand what bastard meant. And Arya he missed her even more than Robb, skinny little thing that she was, all scraped knees and tangled hair and torn clothes, so fierce and willful. Arya never seemed to fit, no more than he had yet she could always make Jon smile. He would give anything to be with her now, to muss up her hair once more and watch her make a face, to hear her finish a sentence with him.
  You broke my wrist, bastard boy.
  Jon lifted his eyes at the sullen voice. Grenn loomed over him, thick of neck and red of face, with three of his friends behind him. He knew Todder, a short ugly boy with an unpleasant voice. The recruits all called him Toad. The other two were the ones Yoren had brought north with them, Jon remembered, rapers taken down in the Fingers. Hed forgotten their names. He hardly ever spoke to them, if he could help it. They were brutes and bullies, without a thimble of honor between them.
  Jon stood up. Ill break the other one for you if you ask nicely. Grenn was sixteen and a head taller than Jon. All four of them were bigger than he was, but they did not scare him. Hed beaten every one of them in the yard.
  Maybe well break you, one of the rapers said.
  Try. Jon reached back for his sword, but one of them grabbed his arm and twisted it behind his back.
  You make us look bad, complained Toad.
  You looked bad before I ever met you, Jon told him. The boy who had his arm jerked upward on him, hard. Pain lanced through him, but Jon would not cry out.
  Toad stepped close. The little lordling has a mouth on him, he said. He had pig eyes, small and shiny. Is that your mommys mouth, bastard? What was she, some whore? Tell us her name. Maybe I had her a time or two. He laughed.
  Jon twisted like an eel and slammed a heel down across the instep of the boy holding him. There was a sudden cry of pain, and he was free. He flew at Toad, knocked him backward over a bench, and landed on his chest with both hands on his throat, slamming his head against the packed earth.
  The two from the Fingers pulled him off, throwing him roughly to the ground. Grenn began to kick at him. Jon was rolling away from the blows when a booming voice cut through the gloom of the armory. STOP THIS! NOW!
  Jon pulled himself to his feet. Donal Noye stood glowering at them. The yard is for fighting, the armorer said. Keep your quarrels out of my armory, or Ill make them my quarrels. You wont like that.
  Toad sat on the floor, gingerly feeling the back of his head. His fingers came away bloody. He tried to kill me.
  S true. I saw it, one of the rapers put in.
  He broke my wrist, Grenn said again, holding it out to Noye for inspection.
  The armorer gave the offered wrist the briefest of glances. A bruise. Perhaps a sprain. Maester Aemon will give you a salve. Go with him, Todder, that head wants looking after. The rest of you, return to your cells. Not you, Snow. You stay.
  Jon sat heavily on the long wooden bench as the others left, oblivious to the looks they gave him, the silent promises of future retribution. His arm was throbbing.
  The Watch has need of every man it can get, Donal Noye said when they were alone. Even men like Toad. You wont win any honors killing him.
  Jons anger flared. He said my mother was
  a whore. I heard him. What of it?
  Lord Eddard Stark was not a man to sleep with whores, Jon said icily. His honor
  did not prevent him from fathering a bastard. Did it?
  Jon was cold with rage. Can I go?
  You go when I tell you to go.
  Jon stared sullenly at the smoke rising from the brazier, until Noye took him under the chin, thick fingers twisting his head around. Look at me when Im talking to you, boy.
  Jon looked. The armorer had a chest like a keg of ale and a gut to match. His nose was flat and broad, and he always seemed in need of a shave. The left sleeve of his black wool tunic was fastened at the shoulder with a silver pin in the shape of a longsword. Words wont make your mother a whore. She was what she was, and nothing Toad says can change that. You know, we have men on the Wall whose mothers were whores.
  Not my mother, Jon thought stubbornly. He knew nothing of his mother; Eddard Stark would not talk of her. Yet he dreamed of her at times, so often that he could almost see her face. In his dreams, she was beautiful, and highborn, and her eyes were kind.
  You think you had it hard, being a high lords bastard? the armorer went on. That boy Jeren is a septons get, and Cotter Pyke is the baseborn son of a tavern wench. Now he commands Eastwatch by the Sea.
  I dont care, Jon said. I dont care about them and I dont care about you or Thorne or Benjen Stark or any of it. I hate it here. Its too its cold.
  Yes. Cold and hard and mean, thats the Wall, and the men who walk it. Not like the stories your wet nurse told you. Well, piss on the stories and piss on your wet nurse. This is the way it is, and youre here for life, same as the rest of us.
