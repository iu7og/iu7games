A lone white sail shows for an instant Where gleams the sea, an azure streak. What left it in its homeland distant? In alien parts what does it seek? The billow play, the mast bends creaking, The wind, impatient, moans and sighs... It is not joy that it is seeking, For is it happiness it flies. The blue wave dance, they dance and tremble, The suns bright ray caress the seas. And yet for storm it begs, the rebel, As if in storm lurked calm and peace!..
