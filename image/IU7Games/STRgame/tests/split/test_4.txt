A servant approached. Bread, Tyrion told him, and two of those little fish, and a mug of that good dark beer to wash them down. Oh, and some bacon. Burn it until it turns black. The man bowed and moved off. Tyrion turned back to his siblings. Twins, male and female. They looked very much the part this morning. Both had chosen a deep green that matched their eyes. Their blond curls were all a fashionable tumble, and gold ornaments shone at wrists and fingers and throats.
  Tyrion wondered what it would be like to have a twin, and decided that he would rather not know. Bad enough to face himself in a looking glass every day. Another him was a thought too dreadful to contemplate.
  Prince Tommen spoke up. Do you have news of Bran, Uncle?
  I stopped by the sickroom last night, Tyrion announced. There was no change. The maester thought that a hopeful sign.
  I dont want Brandon to die, Tommen said timorously. He was a sweet boy. Not like his brother, but then Jaime and Tyrion were somewhat less than peas in a pod themselves.
  Lord Eddard had a brother named Brandon as well, Jaime mused. One of the hostages murdered by Targaryen. It seems to be an unlucky name.
  Oh, not so unlucky as all that, surely, Tyrion said. The servant brought his plate. He ripped off a chunk of black bread.
  Cersei was studying him warily. What do you mean?
  Tyrion gave her a crooked smile. Why, only that Tommen may get his wish. The maester thinks the boy may yet live. He took a sip of beer.
  Myrcella gave a happy gasp, and Tommen smiled nervously, but it was not the children Tyrion was watching. The glance that passed between Jaime and Cersei lasted no more than a second, but he did not miss it. Then his sister dropped her gaze to the table. That is no mercy. These northern gods are cruel to let the child linger in such pain.
  What were the maesters words? Jaime asked.
  The bacon crunched when he bit into it. Tyrion chewed thoughtfully for a moment and said, He thinks that if the boy were going to die, he would have done so already. It has been four days with no change.
  Will Bran get better, Uncle? little Myrcella asked. She had all of her mothers beauty, and none of her nature.
  His back is broken, little one, Tyrion told her. The fall shattered his legs as well. They keep him alive with honey and water, or he would starve to death. Perhaps, if he wakes, he will be able to eat real food, but he will never walk again.
  If he wakes, Cersei repeated. Is that likely?
  The gods alone know, Tyrion told her. The maester only hopes. He chewed some more bread. I would swear that wolf of his is keeping the boy alive. The creature is outside his window day and night, howling. Every time they chase it away, it returns. The maester said they closed the window once, to shut out the noise, and Bran seemed to weaken. When they opened it again, his heart beat stronger.
  The queen shuddered. There is something unnatural about those animals, she said. They are dangerous. I will not have any of them coming south with us.
  Jaime said, Youll have a hard time stopping them, sister. They follow those girls everywhere.
  Tyrion started on his fish. Are you leaving soon, then?
  Not near soon enough, Cersei said. Then she frowned. Are we leaving? she echoed. What about you? Gods, dont tell me you are staying here?
  Tyrion shrugged. Benjen Stark is returning to the Nights Watch with his brothers bastard. I have a mind to go with them and see this Wall we have all heard so much of.
  Jaime smiled. I hope youre not thinking of taking the black on us, sweet brother.
  Tyrion laughed. What, me, celibate? The whores would go begging from Dorne to Casterly Rock. No, I just want to stand on top of the Wall and piss off the edge of the world.
  Cersei stood abruptly. The children dont need to hear this filth. Tommen, Myrcella, come. She strode briskly from the morning room, her train and her pups trailing behind her.
  Jaime Lannister regarded his brother thoughtfully with those cool green eyes. Stark will never consent to leave Winterfell with his son lingering in the shadow of death.
  He will if Robert commands it, Tyrion said. And Robert will command it. There is nothing Lord Eddard can do for the boy in any case.
  He could end his torment, Jaime said. I would, if it were my son. It would be a mercy.
  I advise against putting that suggestion to Lord Eddard, sweet brother, Tyrion said. He would not take it kindly.
  Even if the boy does live, he will be a cripple. Worse than a cripple. A grotesque. Give me a good clean death.
  Tyrion replied with a shrug that accentuated the twist of his shoulders. Speaking for the grotesques, he said, I beg to differ. Death is so terribly final, while life is full of possibilities.
  Jaime smiled. You are a perverse little imp, arent you?
  Oh, yes, Tyrion admitted. I hope the boy does wake. I would be most interested to hear what he might have to say.
  His brothers smile curdled like sour milk. Tyrion, my sweet brother, he said darkly, there are times when you give me cause to wonder whose side you are on.
  Tyrions mouth was full of bread and fish. He took a swallow of strong black beer to wash it all down, and grinned up wolfishly at Jaime, Why, Jaime, my sweet brother, he said, you wound me. You know how much I love my family.
 Jon
  Jon climbed the steps slowly, trying not to think that this might be the last time ever. Ghost padded silently beside him. Outside, snow swirled through the castle gates, and the yard was all noise and chaos, but inside the thick stone walls it was still warm and quiet. Too quiet for Jons liking.
  He reached the landing and stood for a long moment, afraid. Ghost nuzzled at his hand. He took courage from that. He straightened, and entered the room.
  Lady Stark was there beside his bed. She had been there, day and night, for close on a fortnight. Not for a moment had she left Brans side. She had her meals brought to her there, and chamber pots as well, and a small hard bed to sleep on, though it was said she had scarcely slept at all. She fed him herself, the honey and water and herb mixture that sustained life. Not once did she leave the room. So Jon had stayed away.
  But now there was no more time.
  He stood in the door for a moment, afraid to speak, afraid to come closer. The window was open. Below, a wolf howled. Ghost heard and lifted his head.
  Lady Stark looked over. For a moment she did not seem to recognize him. Finally she blinked. What are you doing here? she asked in a voice strangely flat and emotionless.
  I came to see Bran, Jon said. To say good-bye.
  Her face did not change. Her long auburn hair was dull and tangled. She looked as though she had aged twenty years. Youve said it. Now go away.
  Part of him wanted only to flee, but he knew that if he did he might never see Bran again. He took a nervous step into the room. Please, he said.
  Something cold moved in her eyes. I told you to leave, she said. We dont want you here.
  Once that would have sent him running. Once that might even have made him cry. Now it only made him angry. He would be a Sworn Brother of the Nights Watch soon, and face worse dangers than Catelyn Tully Stark. Hes my brother, he said.
  Shall I call the guards?
  Call them, Jon said, defiant. You cant stop me from seeing him. He crossed the room, keeping the bed between them, and looked down on Bran where he lay.
  She was holding one of his hands. It looked like a claw. This was not the Bran he remembered. The flesh had all gone from him. His skin stretched tight over bones like sticks. Under the blanket, his legs bent in ways that made Jon sick. His eyes were sunken deep into black pits; open, but they saw nothing. The fall had shrunken him somehow. He looked half a leaf, as if the first strong wind would carry him off to his grave.
  Yet under the frail cage of those shattered ribs, his chest rose and fell with each shallow breath.
  Bran, he said, Im sorry I didnt come before. I was afraid. He could feel the tears rolling down his cheeks. Jon no longer cared. Dont die, Bran. Please. Were all waiting for you to wake up. Me and Robb and the girls, everyone
  Lady Stark was watching. She had not raised a cry. Jon took that for acceptance. Outside the window, the direwolf howled again. The wolf that Bran had not had time to name.
  I have to go now, Jon said. Uncle Benjen is waiting. Im to go north to the Wall. We have to leave today, before the snows come. He remembered how excited Bran had been at the prospect of the journey. It was more than he could bear, the thought of leaving him behind like this. Jon brushed away his tears, leaned over, and kissed his brother lightly on the lips.
  I wanted him to stay here with me, Lady Stark said softly.
  Jon watched her, wary. She was not even looking at him. She was talking to him, but for a part of her, it was as though he were not even in the room.
  I prayed for it, she said dully. He was my special boy. I went to the sept and prayed seven times to the seven faces of god that Ned would change his mind and leave him here with me. Sometimes prayers are answered.
  Jon did not know what to say. It wasnt your fault, he managed after an awkward silence.
  Her eyes found him. They were full of poison. I need none of your absolution, bastard.
  Jon lowered his eyes. She was cradling one of Brans hands. He took the other, squeezed it. Fingers like the bones of birds. Good-bye, he said.
  He was at the door when she called out to him. Jon, she said. He should have kept going, but she had never called him by his name before. He turned to find her looking at his face, as if she were seeing it for the first time.
  Yes? he said.
  It should have been you, she told him. Then she turned back to Bran and began to weep, her whole body shaking with the sobs. Jon had never seen her cry before.
  It was a long walk down to the yard.
  Outside, everything was noise and confusion. Wagons were being loaded, men were shouting, horses were being harnessed and saddled and led from the stables. A light snow had begun to fall, and everyone was in an uproar to be off.
  Robb was in the middle of it, shouting commands with the best of them. He seemed to have grown of late, as if Brans fall and his mothers collapse had somehow made him stronger. Grey Wind was at his side.
  Uncle Benjen is looking for you, he told Jon. He wanted to be gone an hour ago.
  I know, Jon said. Soon. He looked around at all the noise and confusion. Leaving is harder than I thought.
  For me too, Robb said. He had snow in his hair, melting from the heat of his body. Did you see him?
  Jon nodded, not trusting himself to speak.
  Hes not going to die, Robb said. I know it.
  You Starks are hard to kill, Jon agreed. His voice was flat and tired. The visit had taken all the strength from him.
  Robb knew something was wrong. My mother
  She was very kind, Jon told him.
  Robb looked relieved. Good. He smiled. The next time I see you, youll be all in black.
  Jon forced himself to smile back. It was always my color. How long do you think it will be?
  Soon enough, Robb promised. He pulled Jon to him and embraced him fiercely. Farewell, Snow.
  Jon hugged him back. And you, Stark. Take care of Bran.
  I will. They broke apart and looked at each other awkwardly. Uncle Benjen said to send you to the stables if I saw you, Robb finally said.
  I have one more farewell to make, Jon told him.
  Then I havent seen you, Robb replied. Jon left him standing there in the snow, surrounded by wagons and wolves and horses. It was a short walk to the armory. He picked up his package and took the covered bridge across to the Keep.
  Arya was in her room, packing a polished ironwood chest that was bigger than she was. Nymeria was helping. Arya would only have to point, and the wolf would bound across the room, snatch up some wisp of silk in her jaws, and fetch it back. But when she smelled Ghost, she sat down on her haunches and yelped at them.
  Arya glanced behind her, saw Jon, and jumped to her feet. She threw her skinny arms tight around his neck. I was afraid you were gone, she said, her breath catching in her throat. They wouldnt let me out to say good-bye.
  What did you do now? Jon was amused.
  Arya disentangled herself from him and made a face. Nothing. I was all packed and everything. She gestured at the huge chest, no more than a third full, and at the clothes that were scattered all over the room. Septa Mordane says I have to do it all over. My things werent properly folded, she says. A proper southron lady doesnt just throw her clothes inside her chest like old rags, she says.
  Is that what you did, little sister?
  Well, theyre going to get all messed up anyway, she said. Who cares how theyre folded?
  Septa Mordane, Jon told her. I dont think shed like Nymeria helping, either. The she-wolf regarded him silently with her dark golden eyes. Its just as well. I have something for you to take with you, and it has to be packed very carefully.
  Her face lit up. A present?
  You could call it that. Close the door.
  Wary but excited, Arya checked the hall. Nymeria, here. Guard. She left the wolf out there to warn of intruders and closed the door. By then Jon had pulled off the rags hed wrapped it in. He held it out to her.
  Aryas eyes went wide. Dark eyes, like his. A sword, she said in a small, hushed breath.
  The scabbard was soft grey leather, supple as sin. Jon drew out the blade slowly, so she could see the deep blue sheen of the steel. This is no toy, he told her. Be careful you dont cut yourself. The edges are sharp enough to shave with.
  Girls dont shave, Arya said.
  Maybe they should. Have you ever seen the septas legs?
  She giggled at him. Its so skinny.
  So are you, Jon told her. I had Mikken make this special. The bravos use swords like this in Pentos and Myr and the other Free Cities. It wont hack a mans head off, but it can poke him full of holes if youre fast enough.
  I can be fast, Arya said.
  Youll have to work at it every day. He put the sword in her hands, showed her how to hold it, and stepped back. How does it feel? Do you like the balance?
  I think so, Arya said.
  First lesson, Jon said. Stick them with the pointy end.
  Arya gave him a whap on the arm with the flat of her blade. The blow stung, but Jon found himself grinning like an idiot. I know which end to use, Arya said. A doubtful look crossed her face. Septa Mordane will take it away from me.
  Not if she doesnt know you have it, Jon said.
  Who will I practice with?
  Youll find someone, Jon promised her. Kings Landing is a true city, a thousand times the size of Winterfell. Until you find a partner, watch how they fight in the yard. Run, and ride, make yourself strong. And whatever you do
  Arya knew what was coming next. They said it together.
  dont tell Sansa!
  Jon messed up her hair. I will miss you, little sister.
  Suddenly she looked like she was going to cry. I wish you were coming with us.
  Different roads sometimes lead to the same castle. Who knows? He was feeling better now. He was not going to let himself be sad. I better go. Ill spend my first year on the Wall emptying chamber pots if I keep Uncle Ben waiting any longer.
  Arya ran to him for a last hug. Put down the sword first, Jon warned her, laughing. She set it aside almost shyly and showered him with kisses.
  When he turned back at the door, she was holding it again, trying it for balance. I almost forgot, he told her. All the best swords have names.
  Like Ice, she said. She looked at the blade in her hand. Does this have a name? Oh, tell me.
  Cant you guess? Jon teased. Your very favorite thing.
  Arya seemed puzzled at first. Then it came to her. She was that quick. They said it together:
  Needle!
  The memory of her laughter warmed him on the long ride north.
 Daenerys
  Daenerys Targaryen wed Khal Drogo with fear and barbaric splendor in a field beyond the walls of Pentos, for the Dothraki believed that all things of importance in a mans life must be done beneath the open sky.
  Drogo had called his khalasar to attend him and they had come, forty thousand Dothraki warriors and uncounted numbers of women, children, and slaves. Outside the city walls they camped with their vast herds, raising palaces of woven grass, eating everything in sight, and making the good folk of Pentos more anxious with every passing day.
  My fellow magisters have doubled the size of the city guard, Illyrio told them over platters of honey duck and orange snap peppers one night at the manse that had been Drogos. The khal had joined his khalasar, his estate given over to Daenerys and her brother until the wedding.
  Best we get Princess Daenerys wedded quickly before they hand half the wealth of Pentos away to sellswords and bravos, Ser Jorah Mormont jested. The exile had offered her brother his sword the night Dany had been sold to Kbal Drogo; Viserys had accepted eagerly. Mormont had been their constant companion ever since.
  Magister Illyrio laughed lightly through his forked beard, but Viserys did not so much as smile. He can have her tomorrow, if he likes, her brother said. He glanced over at Dany, and she lowered her eyes. So long as he pays the price.
  Illyrio waved a languid hand in the air, rings glittering on his fat fingers. I have told you, all is settled. Trust me. The khal has promised you a crown, and you shall have it.
  Yes, but when?
  When the khal chooses, Illyrio said. He will have the girl first, and after they are wed he must make his procession across the plains and present her to the dosh khaleen at Vaes Dothrak. After that, perhaps. If the omens favor war.
  Viserys seethed with impatience. I piss on Dothraki omens. The Usurper sits on my fathers throne. How long must I wait?
  Illyrio gave a massive shrug. You have waited most of your life, great king. What is another few months, another few years?
  Ser Jorah, who had traveled as far east as Vaes Dothrak, nodded in agreement. I counsel you to be patient, Your Grace. The Dothraki are true to their word, but they do things in their own time. A lesser man may beg a favor from the khal, but must never presume to berate him.
  Viserys bristled. Guard your tongue, Mormont, or Ill have it out. I am no lesser man, I am the rightful Lord of the Seven Kingdoms. The dragon does not beg.
  Ser Jorah lowered his eyes respectfully. Illyrio smiled enigmatically and tore a wing from the duck. Honey and grease ran over his fingers and dripped down into his beard as he nibbled at the tender meat. There are no more dragons, Dany thought, staring at her brother, though she did not dare say it aloud.
  Yet that night she dreamt of one. Viserys was hitting her, hurting her. She was naked, clumsy with fear. She ran from him, but her body seemed thick and ungainly. He struck her again. She stumbled and fell. You woke the dragon, he screamed as he kicked her. You woke the dragon, you woke the dragon. Her thighs were slick with blood. She closed her eyes and whimpered. As if in answer, there was a hideous ripping sound and the crackling of some great fire. When she looked again, Viserys was gone, great columns of flame rose all around, and in the midst of them was the dragon. It turned its great head slowly. When its molten eyes found hers, she woke, shaking and covered with a fine sheen of sweat. She had never been so afraid
   until the day of her wedding came at last.
  The ceremony began at dawn and continued until dusk, an endless day of drinking and feasting and fighting. A mighty earthen ramp had been raised amid the grass palaces, and there Dany was seated beside Khal Drogo, above the seething sea of Dothraki. She had never seen so many people in one place, nor people so strange and frightening. The horselords might put on rich fabrics and sweet perfumes when they visited the Free Cities, but out under the open sky they kept the old ways. Men and women alike wore painted leather vests over bare chests and horsehair leggings cinched by bronze medallion belts, and the warriors greased their long braids with fat from the rendering pits. They gorged themselves on horseflesh roasted with honey and peppers, drank themselves blind on fermented mares milk and Illyrios fine wines, and spat jests at each other across the fires, their voices harsh and alien in Danys ears.
  Viserys was seated just below her, splendid in a new black wool tunic with a scarlet dragon on the chest. Illyrio and Ser Jorah sat beside him. Theirs was a place of high honor, just below the khals own bloodriders, but Dany could see the anger in her brothers lilac eyes. He did not like sitting beneath her, and he fumed when the slaves offered each dish first to the khal and his bride, and served him from the portions they refused. He could do nothing but nurse his resentment, so nurse it he did, his mood growing blacker by the hour at each insult to his person.
  Dany had never felt so alone as she did seated in the midst of that vast horde. Her brother had told her to smile, and so she smiled until her face ached and the tears came unbidden to her eyes. She did her best to hide them, knowing how angry Viserys would be if he saw her crying, terrified of how Khal Drogo might react. Food was brought to her, steaming joints of meat and thick black sausages and Dothraki blood pies, and later fruits and sweetgrass stews and delicate pastries from the kitchens of Pentos, but she waved it all away. Her stomach was a roil, and she knew she could keep none of it down.
  There was no one to talk to. Khal Drogo shouted commands and jests down to his bloodriders, and laughed at their replies, but he scarcely glanced at Dany beside him. They had no common language. Dothraki was incomprehensible to her, and the khal knew only a few words of the bastard Valyrian of the Free Cities, and none at all of the Common Tongue of the Seven Kingdoms. She would even have welcomed the conversation of Illyrio and her brother, but they were too far below to hear her.
  So she sat in her wedding silks, nursing a cup of honeyed wine, afraid to eat, talking silently to herself. I am blood of the dragon, she told herself. I am Daenerys Stormborn, Princess of Dragonstone, of the blood and seed of Aegon the Conqueror.
  The sun was only a quarter of the way up the sky when she saw her first man die. Drums were beating as some of the women danced for the khal. Drogo watched without expression, but his eyes followed their movements, and from time to time he would toss down a bronze medallion for the women to fight over.
  The warriors were watching too. One of them finally stepped into the circle, grabbed a dancer by the arm, pushed her down to the ground, and mounted her right there, as a stallion mounts a mare. Illyrio had told her that might happen. The Dothraki mate like the animals in their herds. There is no privacy in a khalasar, and they do not understand sin or shame as we do.
  Dany looked away from the coupling, frightened when she realized what was happening, but a second warrior stepped forward, and a third, and soon there was no way to avert her eyes. Then two men seized the same woman. She heard a shout, saw a shove, and in the blink of an eye the arakhs were out, long razor-sharp blades, half sword and half scythe. A dance of death began as the warriors circled and slashed, leaping toward each other, whirling the blades around their heads, shrieking insults at each clash. No one made a move to interfere.
  It ended as quickly as it began. The arakhs shivered together faster than Dany could follow, one man missed a step, the other swung his blade in a flat arc. Steel bit into flesh just above the Dothrakis waist, and opened him from backbone to belly button, spilling his entrails into the dust. As the loser died, the winner took hold of the nearest womannot even the one they had been quarreling overand had her there and then. Slaves carried off the body, and the dancing resumed.
  Magister Illyrio had warned Dany about this too. A Dothraki wedding without at least three deaths is deemed a dull affair, he had said. Her wedding must have been especially blessed; before the day was over, a dozen men had died.
  As the hours passed, the terror grew in Dany, until it was all she could do not to scream. She was afraid of the Dothraki, whose ways seemed alien and monstrous, as if they were beasts in human skins and not true men at all. She was afraid of her brother, of what he might do if she failed him. Most of all, she was afraid of what would happen tonight under the stars, when her brother gave her up to the hulking giant who sat drinking beside her with a face as still and cruel as a bronze mask.
  I am the blood of the dragon, she told herself again.
  When at last the sun was low in the sky, Khal Drogo clapped his hands together, and the drums and the shouting and feasting came to a sudden halt. Drogo stood and pulled Dany to her feet beside him. It was time for her bride gifts.
  And after the gifts, she knew, after the sun had gone down, it would be time for the first ride and the consummation of her marriage. Dany tried to put the thought aside, but it would not leave her. She hugged herself to try to keep from shaking.
  Her brother Viserys gifted her with three handmaids. Dany knew they had cost him nothing; Illyrio no doubt had provided the girls. Irri and Jhiqui were copper-skinned Dothraki with black hair and almond-shaped eyes, Doreah a fair-haired, blue-eyed Lysene girl. These are no common servants, sweet sister, her brother told her as they were brought forward one by one. Illyrio and I selected them personally for you. Irri will teach you riding, Jhiqui the Dothraki tongue, and Doreah will instruct you in the womanly arts of love. He smiled thinly. Shes very good, Illyrio and I can both swear to that.
  Ser Jorah Mormont apologized for his gift. It is a small thing, my princess, but all a poor exile could afford, he said as he laid a small stack of old books before her. They were histories and songs of the Seven Kingdoms, she saw, written in the Common Tongue. She thanked him with all her heart.
  Magister Illyrio murmured a command, and four burly slaves hurried forward, bearing between them a great cedar chest bound in bronze. When she opened it, she found piles of the finest velvets and damasks the Free Cities could produce and resting on top, nestled in the soft cloth, three huge eggs. Dany gasped. They were the most beautiful things she had ever seen, each different than the others, patterned in such rich colors that at first she thought they were crusted with jewels, and so large it took both of her hands to hold one. She lifted it delicately, expecting that it would be made of some fine porcelain or delicate enamel, or even blown glass, but it was much heavier than that, as if it were all of solid stone. The surface of the shell was covered with tiny scales, and as she turned the egg between her fingers, they shimmered like polished metal in the light of the setting sun. One egg was a deep green, with burnished bronze flecks that came and went depending on how Dany turned it. Another was pale cream streaked with gold. The last was black, as black as a midnight sea, yet alive with scarlet ripples and swirls. What are they? she asked, her voice hushed and full of wonder.
  Dragons eggs, from the Shadow Lands beyond Asshai, said Magister Illyrio. The eons have turned them to stone, yet still they burn bright with beauty.
  I shall treasure them always. Dany had heard tales of such eggs, but she had never seen one, nor thought to see one. It was a truly magnificent gift, though she knew that Illyrio could afford to be lavish. He had collected a fortune in horses and slaves for his part in selling her to Khal Drogo.
  The khals bloodriders offered her the traditional three weapons, and splendid weapons they were. Haggo gave her a great leather whip with a silver handle, Cohollo a magnificent arakh chased in gold, and Qotho a double-curved dragonbone bow taller than she was. Magister Illyrio and Ser Jorah had taught her the traditional refusals for these offerings. This is a gift worthy of a great warrior, O blood of my blood, and I am but a woman. Let my lord husband bear these in my stead. And so Khal Drogo too received his bride gifts.
  Other gifts she was given in plenty by other Dothraki: slippers and jewels and silver rings for her hair, medallion belts and painted vests and soft furs, sandsilks and jars of scent, needles and feathers and tiny bottles of purple glass, and a gown made from the skin of a thousand mice. A handsome gift, Khaleesi, Magister Illyrio said of the last, after he had told her what it was. Most lucky. The gifts mounted up around her in great piles, more gifts than she could possibly imagine, more gifts than she could want or use.
  And last of all, Khal Drogo brought forth his own bride gift to her. An expectant hush rippled out from the center of the camp as he left her side, growing until it had swallowed the whole khalasar. When he returned, the dense press of Dothraki gift-givers parted before him, and he led the horse to her.
  She was a young filly, spirited and splendid. Dany knew just enough about horses to know that this was no ordinary animal. There was something about her that took the breath away. She was grey as the winter sea, with a mane like silver smoke.
  Hesitantly she reached out and stroked the horses neck, ran her fingers through the silver of her mane. Khal Drogo said something in Dothraki and Magister Illyrio translated. Silver for the silver of your hair, the khal says.
  Shes beautiful, Dany murmured.
  She is the pride of the khalasar, Illyrio said. Custom decrees that the khaleesi must ride a mount worthy of her place by the side of the khal.
  Drogo stepped forward and put his hands on her waist. He lifted her up as easily
