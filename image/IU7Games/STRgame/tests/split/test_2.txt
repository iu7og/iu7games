Near four thousand men had burned that day, among them King Mern of the Reach. King Loren had escaped, and lived long enough to surrender, pledge his fealty to the Targaryens, and beget a son, for which Tyrion was duly grateful.
  Why do you read so much?
  Tyrion looked up at the sound of the voice. Jon Snow was standing a few feet away, regarding him curiously. He closed the book on a finger and said, Look at me and tell me what you see.
  The boy looked at him suspiciously. Is this some kind of trick? I see you. Tyrion Lannister.
  Tyrion sighed. You are remarkably polite for a bastard, Snow. What you see is a dwarf. You are what, twelve?
  Fourteen, the boy said.
  Fourteen, and youre taller than I will ever be. My legs are short and twisted, and I walk with difficulty. I require a special saddle to keep from falling off my horse. A saddle of my own design, you may be interested to know. It was either that or ride a pony. My arms are strong enough, but again, too short. I will never make a swordsman. Had I been born a peasant, they might have left me out to die, or sold me to some slavers grotesquerie. Alas, I was born a Lannister of Casterly Rock, and the grotesqueries are all the poorer. Things are expected of me. My father was the Hand of the King for twenty years. My brother later killed that very same king, as it turns out, but life is full of these little ironies. My sister married the new king and my repulsive nephew will be king after him. I must do my part for the honor of my House, wouldnt you agree? Yet how? Well, my legs may be too small for my body, but my head is too large, although I prefer to think it is just large enough for my mind. I have a realistic grasp of my own strengths and weaknesses. My mind is my weapon. My brother has his sword, King Robert has his warhammer, and I have my mind and a mind needs books as a sword needs a whetstone, if it is to keep its edge. Tyrion tapped the leather cover of the book. Thats why I read so much, Jon Snow.
  The boy absorbed that all in silence. He had the Stark face if not the name: long, solemn, guarded, a face that gave nothing away. Whoever his mother had been, she had left little of herself in her son. What are you reading about? he asked.
  Dragons, Tyrion told him.
  What good is that? There are no more dragons, the boy said with the easy certainty of youth.
  So they say, Tyrion replied. Sad, isnt it? When I was your age, used to dream of having a dragon of my own.
  You did? the boy said suspiciously. Perhaps he thought Tyrion was making fun of him.
  Oh, yes. Even a stunted, twisted, ugly little boy can look down over the world when hes seated on a dragons back. Tyrion pushed the bearskin aside and climbed to his feet. I used to start fires in the bowels of Casterly Rock and stare at the flames for hours, pretending they were dragonfire. Sometimes Id imagine my father burning. At other times, my sister. Jon Snow was staring at him, a look equal parts horror and fascination. Tyrion guffawed. Dont look at me that way, bastard. I know your secret. Youve dreamt the same kind of dreams.
  No, Jon Snow said, horrified. I wouldnt
  No? Never? Tyrion raised an eyebrow. Well, no doubt the Starks have been terribly good to you. Im certain Lady Stark treats you as if you were one of her own. And your brother Robb, hes always been kind, and why not? He gets Winterfell and you get the Wall. And your father he must have good reasons for packing you off to the Nights Watch
  Stop it, Jon Snow said, his face dark with anger. The Nights Watch is a noble calling!
  Tyrion laughed. Youre too smart to believe that. The Nights Watch is a midden heap for all the misfits of the realm. Ive seen you looking at Yoren and his boys. Those are your new brothers, Jon Snow, how do you like them? Sullen peasants, debtors, poachers, rapers, thieves, and bastards like you all wind up on the Wall, watching for grumkins and snarks and all the other monsters your wet nurse warned you about. The good part is there are no grumkins or snarks, so its scarcely dangerous work. The bad part is you freeze your balls off, but since youre not allowed to breed anyway, I dont suppose that matters.
  Stop it! the boy screamed. He took a step forward, his hands coiling into fists, close to tears.
  Suddenly, absurdly, Tyrion felt guilty. He took a step forward, intending to give the boy a reassuring pat on the shoulder or mutter some word of apology.
  He never saw the wolf, where it was or how it came at him. One moment he was walking toward Snow and the next he was flat on his back on the hard rocky ground, the book spinning away from him as he fell, the breath going out of him at the sudden impact, his mouth full of dirt and blood and rotting leaves. As he tried to get up, his back spasmed painfully. He must have wrenched it in the fall. He ground his teeth in frustration, grabbed a root, and pulled himself back to a sitting position. Help me, he said to the boy, reaching up a hand.
  And suddenly the wolf was between them. He did not growl. The damned thing never made a sound. He only looked at him with those bright red eyes, and showed him his teeth, and that was more than enough. Tyrion sagged back to the ground with a grunt. Dont help me, then. Ill sit right here until you leave.
  Jon Snow stroked Ghosts thick white fur, smiling now. Ask me nicely.
  Tyrion Lannister felt the anger coiling inside him, and crushed it out with a will. It was not the first time in his life he had been humiliated, and it would not be the last. Perhaps he even deserved this. I should be very grateful for your kind assistance, Jon, he said mildly.
  Down, Ghost, the boy said. The direwolf sat on his haunches. Those red eyes never left Tyrion. Jon came around behind him, slid his hands under his arms, and lifted him easily to his feet. Then he picked up the book and handed it back.
  Why did he attack me? Tyrion asked with a sidelong glance at the direwolf. He wiped blood and dirt from his mouth with the back of his hand.
  Maybe he thought you were a grumkin.
  Tyrion glanced at him sharply. Then he laughed, a raw snort of amusement that came bursting out through his nose entirely without his permission. Oh, gods, he said, choking on his laughter and shaking his head, I suppose I do rather look like a grumkin. What does he do to snarks?
  You dont want to know. Jon picked up the wineskin and handed it to Tyrion.
  Tyrion pulled out the stopper, tilted his head, and squeezed a long stream into his mouth. The wine was cool fire as it trickled down his throat and warmed his belly. He held out the skin to Jon Snow. Want some?
  The boy took the skin and tried a cautious swallow. Its true, isnt it? he said when he was done. What you said about the Nights Watch.
  Tyrion nodded.
  Jon Snow set his mouth in a grim line. If thats what it is, thats what it is.
  Tyrion grinned at him. Thats good, bastard. Most men would rather deny a hard truth than face it.
  Most men, the boy said. But not you.
  No, Tyrion admitted, not me. I seldom even dream of dragons anymore. There are no dragons. He scooped up the fallen bearskin. Come, we had better return to camp before your uncle calls the banners.
  The walk was short, but the ground was rough underfoot and his legs were cramping badly by the time they got back. Jon Snow offered a hand to help him over a thick tangle of roots, but Tyrion shook him off. He would make his own way, as he had all his life. Still, the camp was a welcome sight. The shelters had been thrown up against the tumbledown wall of a long-abandoned holdfast, a shield against the wind. The horses had been fed and a fire had been laid. Yoren sat on a stone, skinning a squirrel. The savory smell of stew filled Tyrions nostrils. He dragged himself over to where his man Morrec was tending the stewpot. Wordlessly, Morrec handed him the ladle. Tyrion tasted and handed it back. More pepper, he said.
  Benjen Stark emerged from the shelter he shared with his nephew. There you are. Jon, damn it, dont go off like that by yourself. I thought the Others had gotten you.
  It was the grumkins, Tyrion told him, laughing. Jon Snow smiled. Stark shot a baffled look at Yoren. The old man grunted, shrugged, and went back to his bloody work.
  The squirrel gave some body to the stew, and they ate it with black bread and hard cheese that night around their fire. Tyrion shared around his skin of wine until even Yoren grew mellow. One by one the company drifted off to their shelters and to sleep, all but Jon Snow, who had drawn the nights first watch.
  Tyrion was the last to retire, as always. As he stepped into the shelter his men had built for him, he paused and looked back at Jon Snow. The boy stood near the fire, his face still and hard, looking deep into the flames.
  Tyrion Lannister smiled sadly and went to bed.
 Catelyn
  Ned and the girls were eight days gone when Maester Luwin came to her one night in Brans sickroom, carrying a reading lamp and the books of account. It is past time that we reviewed the figures, my lady, he said. Youll want to know how much this royal visit cost us.
  Catelyn looked at Bran in his sickbed and brushed his hair back off his forehead. It had grown very long, she realized. She would have to cut it soon. I have no need to look at figures, Maester Luwin, she told him, never taking her eyes from Bran. I know what the visit cost us. Take the books away.
  My lady, the kings party had healthy appetites. We must replenish our stores before
  She cut him off. I said, take the books away. The steward will attend to our needs.
  We have no steward, Maester Luwin reminded her. Like a little grey rat, she thought, he would not let go. Poole went south to establish Lord Eddards household at Kings Landing.
  Catelyn nodded absently. Oh, yes. I remember. Bran looked so pale. She wondered whether they might move his bed under the window, so he could get the morning sun.
  Maester Luwin set the lamp in a niche by the door and fiddled with its wick. There are several appointments that require your immediate attention, my lady. Besides the steward, we need a captain of the guards to fill Jorys place, a new master of horse
  Her eyes snapped around and found him. A master of horse? Her voice was a whip.
  The maester was shaken. Yes, my lady. Hullen rode south with Lord Eddard, so
  My son lies here broken and dying, Luwin, and you wish to discuss a new master of horse? Do you think I care what happens in the stables? Do you think it matters to me one whit? I would gladly butcher every horse in Winterfell with my own hands if it would open Brans eyes, do you understand that? Do you?
  He bowed his head. Yes, my lady, but the appointments
  Ill make the appointments, Robb said.
  Catelyn had not heard him enter, but there he stood in the doorway, looking at her. She had been shouting, she realized with a sudden flush of shame. What was happening to her? She was so tired, and her head hurt all the time.
  Maester Luwin looked from Catelyn to her son. I have prepared a list of those we might wish to consider for the vacant offices, he said, offering Robb a paper plucked from his sleeve.
  Her son glanced at the names. He had come from outside, Catelyn saw; his cheeks were red from the cold, his hair shaggy and windblown. Good men, he said. Well talk about them tomorrow. He handed back the list of names.
  Very good, my lord. The paper vanished into his sleeve.
  Leave us now, Robb said. Maester Luwin bowed and departed. Robb closed the door behind him and turned to her. He was wearing a sword, she saw. Mother, what are you doing?
  Catelyn had always thought Robb looked like her; like Bran and Rickon and Sansa, he had the Tully coloring, the auburn hair, the blue eyes. Yet now for the first time she saw something of Eddard Stark in his face, something as stern and hard as the north. What am I doing? she echoed, puzzled. How can you ask that? What do you imagine Im doing? I am taking care of your brother. I am taking care of Bran.
  Is that what you call it? You havent left this room since Bran was hurt. You didnt even come to the gate when Father and the girls went south.
  I said my farewells to them here, and watched them ride out from that window. She had begged Ned not to go, not now, not after what had happened; everything had changed now, couldnt he see that? It was no use. He had no choice, he had told her, and then he left, choosing. I cant leave him, even for a moment, not when any moment could be his last. I have to be with him, if if She took her sons limp hand, sliding his fingers through her own. He was so frail and thin, with no strength left in his hand, but she could still feel the warmth of life through his skin.
  Robbs voice softened. Hes not going to die, Mother. Maester Luwin says the time of greatest danger has passed.
  And what if Maester Luwin is wrong? What if Bran needs me and Im not here?
  Rickon needs you, Robb said sharply. Hes only three, he doesnt understand whats happening. He thinks everyone has deserted him, so he follows me around all day, clutching my leg and crying. I dont know what to do with him. He paused a moment, chewing on his lower lip the way hed done when he was little. Mother, I need you too. Im trying but I cant I cant do it all by myself. His voice broke with sudden emotion, and Catelyn remembered that he was only fourteen. She wanted to get up and go to him, but Bran was still holding her hand and she could not move.
  Outside the tower, a wolf began to howl. Catelyn trembled, just for a second.
  Brans. Robb opened the window and let the night air into the stuffy tower room. The howling grew louder. It was a cold and lonely sound, full of melancholy and despair.
  Dont, she told him. Bran needs to stay warm.
  He needs to hear them sing, Robb said. Somewhere out in Winterfell, a second wolf began to howl in chorus with the first. Then a third, closer. Shaggydog and Grey Wind, Robb said as their voices rose and fell together. You can tell them apart if you listen close.
  Catelyn was shaking. It was the grief, the cold, the howling of the direwolves. Night after night, the howling and the cold wind and the grey empty castle, on and on they went, never changing, and her boy lying there broken, the sweetest of her children, the gentlest, Bran who loved to laugh and climb and dreamt of knighthood, all gone now, she would never hear him laugh again. Sobbing, she pulled her hand free of his and covered her ears against those terrible howls. Make them stop! she cried. I cant stand it, make them stop, make them stop, kill them all if you must, just make them stop!
  She didnt remember falling to the floor, but there she was, and Robb was lifting her, holding her in strong arms. Dont be afraid, Mother. They would never hurt him. He helped her to her narrow bed in the corner of the sickroom. Close your eyes, he said gently. Rest. Maester Luwin tells me youve hardly slept since Brans fall.
  I cant, she wept. Gods forgive me, Robb, I cant, what if he dies while Im asleep, what if he dies, what if he dies The wolves were still howling. She screamed and held her ears again. Oh, gods, close the window!
  If you swear to me youll sleep. Robb went to the window, but as he reached for the shutters another sound was added to the mournful howling of the direwolves. Dogs, he said, listening. All the dogs are barking. Theyve never done that before Catelyn heard his breath catch in his throat. When she looked up, his face was pale in the lamplight. Fire, he whispered.
  Fire, she thought, and then, Bran! Help me, she said urgently, sitting up. Help me with Bran.
  Robb did not seem to hear her. The library towers on fire, he said.
  Catelyn could see the flickering reddish light through the open window now. She sagged with relief. Bran was safe. The library was across the bailey, there was no way the fire would reach them here. Thank the gods, she whispered.
  Robb looked at her as if shed gone mad. Mother, stay here. Ill come back as soon as the fires out. He ran then. She heard him shout to the guards outside the room, heard them descending together in a wild rush, taking the stairs two and three at a time.
  Outside, there were shouts of Fire! in the yard, screams, running footsteps, the whinny of frightened horses, and the frantic barking of the castle dogs. The howling was gone, she realized as she listened to the cacophony. The direwolves had fallen silent.
  Catelyn said a silent prayer of thanks to the seven faces of god as she went to the window. Across the bailey, long tongues of flame shot from the windows of the library. She watched the smoke rise into the sky and thought sadly of all the books the Starks had gathered over the centuries. Then she closed the shutters.
  When she turned away from the window, the man was in the room with her.
  You werent sposed to be here, he muttered sourly. No one was sposed to be here.
  He was a small, dirty man in filthy brown clothing, and he stank of horses. Catelyn knew all the men who worked in their stables, and he was none of them. He was gaunt, with limp blond hair and pale eyes deep-sunk in a bony face, and there was a dagger in his hand.
  Catelyn looked at the knife, then at Bran. No, she said. The word stuck in her throat, the merest whisper.
  He must have heard her. Its a mercy, he said. Hes dead already.
  No, Catelyn said, louder now as she found her voice again. No, you cant. She spun back toward the window to scream for help, but the man moved faster than she would have believed. One hand clamped down over her mouth and yanked back her head, the other brought the dagger up to her windpipe. The stench of him was overwhelming.
  She reached up with both hands and grabbed the blade with all her strength, pulling it away from her throat. She heard him cursing into her ear. Her fingers were slippery with blood, but she would not let go of the dagger. The hand over her mouth clenched more tightly, shutting off her air. Catelyn twisted her head to the side and managed to get a piece of his flesh between her teeth. She bit down hard into his palm. The man grunted in pain. She ground her teeth together and tore at him, and all of a sudden he let go. The taste of his blood filled her mouth. She sucked in air and screamed, and he grabbed her hair and pulled her away from him, and she stumbled and went down, and then he was standing over her, breathing hard, shaking. The dagger was still clutched tightly in his right hand, slick with blood. You werent sposed to be here, he repeated stupidly.
  Catelyn saw the shadow slip through the open door behind him. There was a low rumble, less than a snarl, the merest whisper of a threat, but he must have heard something, because he started to turn just as the wolf made its leap. They went down together, half sprawled over Catelyn where shed fallen. The wolf had him under the jaw. The mans shriek lasted less than a second before the beast wrenched back its head, taking out half his throat.
  His blood felt like warm rain as it sprayed across her face.
  The wolf was looking at her. Its jaws were red and wet and its eyes glowed golden in the dark room. It was Brans wolf, she realized. Of course it was. Thank you, Catelyn whispered, her voice faint and tiny. She lifted her hand, trembling. The wolf padded closer, sniffed at her fingers, then licked at the blood with a wet rough tongue. When it had cleaned all the blood off her hand, it turned away silently and jumped up on Brans bed and lay down beside him. Catelyn began to laugh hysterically.
  That was the way they found them, when Robb and Maester Luwin and Ser Rodrik burst in with half the guards in Winterfell. When the laughter finally died in her throat, they wrapped her in warm blankets and led her back to the Great Keep, to her own chambers. Old Nan undressed her and helped her into a scalding hot bath and washed the blood off her with a soft cloth.
  Afterward Maester Luwin arrived to dress her wounds. The cuts in her fingers went deep, almost to the bone, and her scalp was raw and bleeding where hed pulled out a handful of hair. The maester told her the pain was just starting now, and gave her milk of the poppy to help her sleep.
  Finally she closed her eyes.
  When she opened them again, they told her that she had slept four days. Catelyn nodded and sat up in bed. It all seemed like a nightmare to her now, everything since Brans fall, a terrible dream of blood and grief, but she had the pain in her hands to remind her that it was real. She felt weak and light-headed, yet strangely resolute, as if a great weight had lifted from her.
  Bring me some bread and honey, she told her servants, and take word to Maester Luwin that my bandages want changing. They looked at her in surprise and ran to do her bidding.
  Catelyn remembered the way she had been before, and she was ashamed. She had let them all down, her children, her husband, her House. It would not happen again. She would show these northerners how strong a Tully of Riverrun could be.
  Robb arrived before her food. Rodrik Cassel came with him, and her husbands ward Theon Greyjoy, and lastly Hallis Mollen, a muscular guardsman with a square brown beard. He was the new captain of the guard, Robb said. Her son was dressed in boiled leather and ringmail, she saw, and a sword hung at his waist.
  Who was he? Catelyn asked them.
  No one knows his name, Hallis Mollen told her. He was no man of Winterfell, mlady, but some says they seen him here and about the castle these past few weeks.
  One of the kings men, then, she said, or one of the Lannisters. He could have waited behind when the others left.
  Maybe, Hal said. With all these strangers filling up Winterfell of late, theres no way of saying who he belonged to.
  Hed been hiding in your stables, Greyjoy said. You could smell it on him.
  And how could he go unnoticed? she said sharply.
  Hallis Mollen looked abashed. Between the horses Lord Eddard took south and them we sent north to the Nights Watch, the stalls were half-empty. It were no great trick to hide from the stableboys. Could be Hodor saw him, the talk is that boys been acting queer, but simple as he is Hal shook his head.
  We found where hed been sleeping, Robb put in. He had ninety silver stags in a leather bag buried beneath the straw.
  Its good to know my sons life was not sold cheaply, Catelyn said bitterly.
  Hallis Mollen looked at her, confused. Begging your grace, mlady, you saying he was out to kill your boy?
  Greyjoy was doubtful. Thats madness.
  He came for Bran, Catelyn said. He kept muttering how I wasnt supposed to be there. He set the library fire thinking I would rush to put it out, taking any guards with me. If I hadnt been half-mad with grief, it would have worked.
  Why would anyone want to kill Bran? Robb said. Gods, hes only a little boy, helpless, sleeping
  Catelyn gave her firstborn a challenging look. If you are to rule in the north, you must think these things through, Robb. Answer your own question. Why would anyone want to kill a sleeping child?
  Before he could answer, the servants returned with a plate of food fresh from the kitchen. There was much more than shed asked for: hot bread, butter and honey and blackberry preserves, a rasher of bacon and a soft-boiled egg, a wedge of cheese, a pot of mint tea. And with it came Maester Luwin.
  How is my son, Maester? Catelyn looked at all the food and found she had no appetite.
  Maester Luwin lowered his eyes. Unchanged, my lady.
  It was the reply she had expected, no more and no less. Her hands throbbed with pain, as if the blade were still in her, cutting deep. She sent the servants away and looked back to Robb. Do you have the answer yet?
  Someone is afraid Bran might wake up, Robb said, afraid of what he might say or do, afraid of something he knows.
  Catelyn was proud of him. Very good. She turned to the new captain of the guard. We must keep Bran safe. If there was one killer, there could be others.
  How many guards do you want, rnlady? Hal asked.
  So long as Lord Eddard is away, my son is the master of Winterfell, she told him.
  Robb stood a little taller. Put one man in the sickroom, night and day, one outside the door, two at the bottom of the stairs. No one sees Bran without my warrant or my mothers.
  As you say, mlord.
  Do it now, Catelyn suggested.
  And let his wolf stay in the room with him, Robb added.
  Yes, Catelyn said. And then again: Yes.
  Hallis Mollen bowed and left the room.
  Lady Stark, Ser Rodrik said when the guardsman had gone, did you chance to notice the dagger the killer used?
  The circumstances did not allow me to examine it closely, but I can vouch for its edge, Catelyn replied with a dry smile. Why do you ask?
  We found the knife still in the villains grasp. It seemed to me that it was altogether too fine a weapon for such a man, so I looked at it long and hard. The blade is Valyrian steel, the hilt dragonbone. A weapon like that has no business being in the hands of such as him. Someone gave it to him.
  Catelyn nodded, thoughtful. Robb, close the door.
  He looked at her strangely, but did as she told him.
  What I am about to tell you must not leave this room, she told them. I want your oaths on that. If even part of what I suspect is true, Ned and my girls have ridden into deadly danger, and a word in the wrong ears could mean their lives.
  Lord Eddard is a second father to me, said Theon Greyjoy. I do so swear.
  You have my oath, Maester Luwin said.
  And mine, my lady, echoed Ser Rodrik.
  She looked at her son. And you, Robb?
  He nodded his consent.
  My sister Lysa believes the Lannisters murdered her husband, Lord Arryn, the Hand of the King, Catelyn told them. It comes to me that Jaime Lannister did not join the hunt the day Bran fell. He remained here in the castle. The room was deathly quiet. I do not think Bran fell from that tower, she said into the stillness. I think he was thrown.
  The shock was plain on their faces. My lady, that is a monstrous suggestion, said Rodrik Cassel. Even the Kingslayer would flinch at the murder of an innocent child.
  Oh, would he? Theon Greyjoy asked. I wonder.
  There is no limit to Lannister pride or Lannister ambition, Catelyn said.
  The boy had always been surehanded in the past, Maester Luwin said thoughtfully. He knew every stone in Winterfell.
  Gods, Robb swore, his young face dark with anger. If this is true, he will pay for it. He drew his sword and waved it in the air. Ill kill him myself!
  Ser Rodrik bristled at him. Put that away! The Lannisters are a hundred leagues away. Never draw your sword unless you mean to use it. How many times must I tell you, foolish boy?
  Abashed, Robb sheathed his sword, suddenly a child again. Catelyn said to Ser Rodrik, I see my son is wearing steel now.
  The old master-at-arms said, I thought it was time.
  Robb was looking at her anxiously. Past time, she said. Winterfell may have need of all its swords soon, and they had best not be made of wood.
  Theon Greyjoy put a hand on the hilt of his blade and said, My lady, if it comes to that, my House owes yours a great debt.
  Maester Luwin pulled at his chain collar where it chafed against his neck. All we have is conjecture. This is the queens beloved brother we mean to accuse. She will not take it kindly. We must have proof, or forever keep silent.
  Your proof is in the dagger, Ser Rodrik said. A fine blade like that will not have gone unnoticed.
  There was only one place to find the truth of it, Catelyn realized. Someone must go to Kings Landing.
  Ill go, Robb said.
  No, she told him. Your place is here. There must always be a Stark in Winterfell. She looked at Ser Rodrik with his great white whiskers, at Maester Luwin in his grey robes, at young Greyjoy, lean and dark and impetuous. Who to send? Who would be believed? Then she knew. Catelyn struggled to push back the blankets, her bandaged fingers as stiff and unyielding as stone. She climbed out of bed. I must go myself.
  My lady, said Maester Luwin, is that wise? Surely the Lannisters would greet your arrival with suspicion.
  What about Bran? Robb asked. The poor boy looked utterly confused now. You cant mean to leave him.
  I have done everything I can for Bran, she said, laying a wounded hand on his arm. His life is in the hands of the gods and Maester Luwin. As you reminded me yourself, Robb, I have other children to think of now.
  You will need a strong escort, my lady, Theon said.
  Ill send Hal with a squad of guardsmen, Robb said.
  No, Catelyn said. A large party attracts unwelcome attention. I would not have the Lannisters know I am coming.
  Ser Rodrik protested. My lady, let me accompany you at least. The kingsroad can be perilous for a woman alone.
  I will not be taking the kingsroad, Catelyn replied. She thought for a moment, then nodded her consent. Two riders can move as fast as one, and a good deal faster than a long column burdened by wagons and wheelhouses. I will welcome your company, Ser Rodrik. We will follow the White Knife down to the sea, and hire a ship at White Harbor. Strong horses and brisk winds should bring us to Kings Landing well ahead of Ned and the Lannisters. And then, she thought, we shall see what we shall see.
