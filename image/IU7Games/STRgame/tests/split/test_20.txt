Robb resisted stubbornly. Ser Rodriks red bitch whelped again last week, he said. It was a small litter, only two live pups. Shell have milk enough.
  Shell rip them apart when they try to nurse.
  Lord Stark, Jon said. It was strange to hear him call Father that, so formal. Bran looked at him with desperate hope. There are five pups, he told Father. Three male, two female.
  What of it, Jon?
  You have five trueborn children, Jon said. Three sons, two daughters. The direwolf is the sigil of your House. Your children were meant to have these pups, my lord.
  Bran saw his fathers face change, saw the other men exchange glances. He loved Jon with all his heart at that moment. Even at seven, Bran understood what his brother had done. The count had come right only because Jon had omitted himself. He had included the girls, included even Rickon, the baby, but not the bastard who bore the surname Snow, the name that custom decreed be given to all those in the north unlucky enough to be born with no name of their own.
  Their father understood as well. You want no pup for yourself, Jon? he asked softly.
  The direwolf graces the banners of House Stark, Jon pointed out. I am no Stark, Father.
  Their lord father regarded Jon thoughtfully. Robb rushed into the silence he left. I will nurse him myself, Father, he promised. I will soak a towel with warm milk, and give him suck from that.
  Me too! Bran echoed.
  The lord weighed his sons long and carefully with his eyes. Easy to say, and harder to do. I will not have you wasting the servants time with this. If you want these pups, you will feed them yourselves. Is that understood?
  Bran nodded eagerly. The pup squirmed in his grasp, licked at his face with a warm tongue.
  You must train them as well, their father said. You must train them. The kennelmaster will have nothing to do with these monsters, I promise you that. And the gods help you if you neglect them, or brutalize them, or train them badly. These are not dogs to beg for treats and slink off at a kick. A direwolf will rip a mans arm off his shoulder as easily as a dog will kill a rat. Are you sure you want this?
  Yes, Father, Bran said.
  Yes, Robb agreed.
  The pups may die anyway, despite all you do.
  They wont die, Robb said. We wont let them die.
  Keep them, then. Jory, Desmond, gather up the other pups. Its time we were back to Winterfell.
  It was not until they were mounted and on their way that Bran allowed himself to taste the sweet air of victory. By then, his pup was snuggled inside his leathers, warm against him, safe for the long ride home. Bran was wondering what to name him.
  Halfway across the bridge, Jon pulled up suddenly.
  What is it, Jon? their lord father asked.
  Cant you hear it?
  Bran could hear the wind in the trees, the clatter of their hooves on the ironwood planks, the whimpering of his hungry pup, but Jon was listening to something else.
  There, Jon said. He swung his horse around and galloped back across the bridge. They watched him dismount where the direwolf lay dead in the snow, watched him kneel. A moment later he was riding back to them, smiling.
  He must have crawled away from the others, Jon said.
  Or been driven away, their father said, looking at the sixth pup. His fur was white, where the rest of the litter was grey. His eyes were as red as the blood of the ragged man who had died that morning. Bran thought it curious that this pup alone would have opened his eyes while the others were still blind.
  An albino, Theon Greyjoy said with wry amusement. This one will die even faster than the others.
  Jon Snow gave his fathers ward a long, chilling look. I think not, Greyjoy, he said. This one belongs to me.
 Catelyn
  Catelyn had never liked this godswood.
  She had been born a Tully, at Riverrun far to the south, on the Red Fork of the Trident. The godswood there was a garden, bright and airy, where tall redwoods spread dappled shadows across tinkling streams, birds sang from hidden nests, and the air was spicy with the scent of flowers.
  The gods of Winterfell kept a different sort of wood. It was a dark, primal place, three acres of old forest untouched for ten thousand years as the gloomy castle rose around it. It smelled of moist earth and decay. No redwoods grew here. This was a wood of stubborn sentinel trees armored in grey-green needles, of mighty oaks, of ironwoods as old as the realm itself. Here thick black trunks crowded close together while twisted branches wove a dense canopy overhead and misshappen roots wrestled beneath the soil. This was a place of deep silence and brooding shadows, and the gods who lived here had no names.
  But she knew she would find her husband here tonight. Whenever he took a mans life, afterward he would seek the quiet of the godswood.
  Catelyn had been anointed with the seven oils and named in the rainbow of light that filled the sept of Riverrun. She was of the Faith, like her father and grandfather and his father before him. Her gods had names, and their faces were as familiar as the faces of her parents. Worship was a septon with a censer, the smell of incense, a seven-sided crystal alive with light, voices raised in song. The Tullys kept a godswood, as all the great houses did, but it was only a place to walk or read or lie in the sun. Worship was for the sept.
  For her sake, Ned had built a small sept where she might sing to the seven faces of god, but the blood of the First Men still flowed in the veins of the Starks, and his own gods were the old ones, the nameless, faceless gods of the greenwood they shared with the vanished children of the forest.
  At the center of the grove an ancient weirwood brooded over a small pool where the waters were black and cold. The heart tree, Ned called it. The weirwoods bark was white as bone, its leaves dark red, like a thousand bloodstained hands. A face had been carved in the trunk of the great tree, its features long and melancholy, the deep-cut eyes red with dried sap and strangely watchful. They were old, those eyes; older than Winterfell itself. They had seen Brandon the Builder set the first stone, if the tales were true; they had watched the castles granite walls rise around them. It was said that the children of the forest had carved the faces in the trees during the dawn centuries before the coming of the First Men across the narrow sea.
  In the south the last weirwoods had been cut down or burned out a thousand years ago, except on the Isle of Faces where the green men kept their silent watch. Up here it was different. Here every castle had its godswood, and every godswood had its heart tree, and every heart tree its face.
  Catelyn found her husband beneath the weirwood, seated on a moss-covered stone. The greatsword Ice was across his lap, and he was cleaning the blade in those waters black as night. A thousand years of humus lay thick upon the godswood floor, swallowing the sound of her feet, but the red eyes of the weirwood seemed to follow her as she came. Ned, she called softly.
  He lifted his head to look at her. Catelyn, he said. His voice was distant and formal. Where are the children?
  He would always ask her that. In the kitchen, arguing about names for the wolf pups. She spread her cloak on the forest floor and sat beside the pool, her back to the weirwood. She could feel the eyes watching her, but she did her best to ignore them. Arya is already in love, and Sansa is charmed and gracious, but Rickon is not quite sure.
  Is he afraid? Ned asked.
  A little, she admitted. He is only three.
  Ned frowned. He must learn to face his fears. He will not be three forever. And winter is coming.
  Yes, Catelyn agreed. The words gave her a chill, as they always did. The Stark words. Every noble house had its words. Family mottoes, touchstones, prayers of sorts, they boasted of honor and glory, promised loyalty and truth, swore faith and courage. All but the Starks. Winter is coming, said the Stark words. Not for the first time, she reflected on what a strange people these northerners were.
  The man died well, Ill give him that, Ned said. He had a swatch of oiled leather in one hand. He ran it lightly up the greatsword as he spoke, polishing the metal to a dark glow. I was glad for Brans sake. You would have been proud of Bran.
  I am always proud of Bran, Catelyn replied, watching the sword as he stroked it. She could see the rippling deep within the steel, where the metal had been folded back on itself a hundred times in the forging. Catelyn had no love for swords, but she could not deny that Ice had its own beauty. It had been forged in Valyria, before the Doom had come to the old Freehold, when the ironsmiths had worked their metal with spells as well as hammers. Four hundred years old it was, and as sharp as the day it was forged. The name it bore was older still, a legacy from the age of heroes, when the Starks were Kings in the North.
  He was the fourth this year, Ned said grimly. The poor man was half-mad. Something had put a fear in him so deep that my words could not reach him. He sighed. Ben writes that the strength of the Nights Watch is down below a thousand. Its not only desertions. They are losing men on rangings as well.
  Is it the wildlings? she asked.
  Who else? Ned lifted Ice, looked down the cool steel length of it. And it will only grow worse. The day may come when I will have no choice but to call the banners and ride north to deal with this King-beyond-the-Wall for good and all.
  Beyond the Wall? The thought made Catelyn shudder.
  Ned saw the dread on her face. Mance Rayder is nothing for us to fear.
  There are darker things beyond the Wall. She glanced behind her at the heart tree, the pale bark and red eyes, watching, listening, thinking its long slow thoughts.
  His smile was gentle. You listen to too many of Old Nans stories. The Others are as dead as the children of the forest, gone eight thousand years. Maester Luwin will tell you they never lived at all. No living man has ever seen one.
  Until this morning, no living man had ever seen a direwolf either, Catelyn reminded him.
  I ought to know better than to argue with a Tully, he said with a rueful smile. He slid Ice back into its sheath. You did not come here to tell me crib tales. I know how little you like this place. What is it, my lady?
  Catelyn took her husbands hand. There was grievous news today, my lord. I did not wish to trouble you until you had cleansed yourself. There was no way to soften the blow, so she told him straight. I am so sorry, my love. Jon Arryn is dead.
  His eyes found hers, and she could see how hard it took him, as she had known it would. In his youth, Ned had fostered at the Eyrie, and the childless Lord Arryn had become a second father to him and his fellow ward, Robert Baratheon. When the Mad King Aerys II Targaryen had demanded their heads, the Lord of the Eyrie had raised his moon-and-falcon banners in revolt rather than give up those he had pledged to protect.
  And one day fifteen years ago, this second father had become a brother as well, as he and Ned stood together in the sept at Riverrun to wed two sisters, the daughters of Lord Hoster Tully.
  Jon he said. Is this news certain?
  It was the kings seal, and the letter is in Roberts own hand. I saved it for you. He said Lord Arryn was taken quickly. Even Maester Pycelle was helpless, but he brought the milk of the poppy, so Jon did not linger long in pain.
  That is some small mercy, I suppose, he said. She could see the grief on his face, but even then he thought first of her. Your sister, he said. And Jons boy. What word of them?
  The message said only that they were well, and had returned to the Eyrie, Catelyn said. I wish they had gone to Riverrun instead. The Eyrie is high and lonely, and it was ever her husbands place, not hers. Lord Jons memory will haunt each stone. I know my sister. She needs the comfort of family and friends around her.
  Your uncle waits in the Vale, does he not? Jon named him Knight of the Gate, Id heard.
  Catelyn nodded. Brynden will do what he can for her, and for the boy. That is some comfort, but still
  Go to her, Ned urged. Take the children. Fill her halls with noise and shouts and laughter. That boy of hers needs other children about him, and Lysa should not be alone in her grief.
  Would that I could, Catelyn said. The letter had other tidings. The king is riding to Winterfell to seek you out.
  It took Ned a moment to comprehend her words, but when the understanding came, the darkness left his eyes. Robert is coming here? When she nodded, a smile broke across his face.
  Catelyn wished she could share his joy. But she had heard the talk in the yards; a direwolf dead in the snow, a broken antler in its throat. Dread coiled within her like a snake, but she forced herself to smile at this man she loved, this man who put no faith in signs. I knew that would please you, she said. We should send word to your brother on the Wall.
  Yes, of course, he agreed. Ben will want to be here. I shall tell Maester Luwin to send his swiftest bird. Ned rose and pulled her to her feet. Damnation, how many years has it been? And he gives us no more notice than this? How many in his party, did the message say?
  I should think a hundred knights, at the least, with all their retainers, and half again as many freeriders. Cersei and the children travel with them.
  Robert will keep an easy pace for their sakes, he said. It is just as well. That will give us more time to prepare.
  The queens brothers are also in the party, she told him.
  Ned grimaced at that. There was small love between him and the queens family, Catelyn knew. The Lannisters of Casterly Rock had come late to Roberts cause, when victory was all but certain, and he had never forgiven them. Well, if the price for Roberts company is an infestation of Lannisters, so be it. It sounds as though Robert is bringing half his court.
  Where the king goes, the realm follows, she said.
  It will be good to see the children. The youngest was still sucking at the Lannister womans teat the last time I saw him. He must be, what, five by now?
  Prince Tommen is seven, she told him. The same age as Bran. Please, Ned, guard your tongue. The Lannister woman is our queen, and her pride is said to grow with every passing year.
  Ned squeezed her hand. There must be a feast, of course, with singers, and Robert will want to hunt. I shall send Jory south with an honor guard to meet them on the kingsroad and escort them back. Gods, how are we going to feed them all? On his way already, you said? Damn the man. Damn his royal hide.
 Daenerys
  Her brother held the gown up for her inspection. This is beauty. Touch it. Go on. Caress the fabric.
  Dany touched it. The cloth was so smooth that it seemed to run through her fingers like water. She could not remember ever wearing anything so soft. It frightened her. She pulled her hand away. Is it really mine?
  A gift from the Magister Illyrio, Viserys said, smiling. Her brother was in a high mood tonight. The color will bring out the violet in your eyes. And you shall have gold as well, and jewels of all sorts. Illyrio has promised. Tonight you must look like a princess.
  A princess, Dany thought. She had forgotten what that was like. Perhaps she had never really known. Why does he give us so much? she asked. What does he want from us? For nigh on half a year, they had lived in the magisters house, eating his food, pampered by his servants. Dany was thirteen, old enough to know that such gifts seldom come without their price, here in the free city of Pentos.
  Illyrio is no fool, Viserys said. He was a gaunt young man with nervous hands and a feverish look in his pale lilac eyes. The magister knows that I will not forget my friends when I come into my throne.
  Dany said nothing. Magister Illyrio was a dealer in spices, gemstones, dragonbone, and other, less savory things. He had friends in all of the Nine Free Cities, it was said, and even beyond, in Vaes Dothrak and the fabled lands beside the Jade Sea. It was also said that hed never had a friend he wouldnt cheerfully sell for the right price. Dany listened to the talk in the streets, and she heard these things, but she knew better than to question her brother when he wove his webs of dream. His anger was a terrible thing when roused. Viserys called it waking the dragon.
  Her brother hung the gown beside the door. Illyrio will send the slaves to bathe you. Be sure you wash off the stink of the stables. Khal Drogo has a thousand horses, tonight he looks for a different sort of mount. He studied her critically. You still slouch. Straighten yourself He pushed back her shoulders with his hands. Let them see that you have a womans shape now. His fingers brushed lightly over her budding breasts and tightened on a nipple. You will not fail me tonight. If you do, it will go hard for you. You dont want to wake the dragon, do you? His fingers twisted her, the pinch cruelly hard through the rough fabric of her tunic. Do you? he repeated.
  No, Dany said meekly.
  Her brother smiled. Good. He touched her hair, almost with affection. When they write the history of my reign, sweet sister, they will say that it began tonight.
  When he was gone, Dany went to her window and looked out wistfully on the waters of the bay. The square brick towers of Pentos were black silhouettes outlined against the setting sun. Dany could hear the singing of the red priests as they lit their night fires and the shouts of ragged children playing games beyond the walls of the estate. For a moment she wished she could be out there with them, barefoot and breathless and dressed in tatters, with no past and no future and no feast to attend at Khal Drogos manse.
  Somewhere beyond the sunset, across the narrow sea, lay a land of green hills and flowered plains and great rushing rivers, where towers of dark stone rose amidst magnificent blue-grey mountains, and armored knights rode to battle beneath the banners of their lords. The Dothraki called that land Rhaesh Andahli, the land of the Andals. In the Free Cities, they talked of Westeros and the Sunset Kingdoms. Her brother had a simpler name. Our land, he called it. The words were like a prayer with him. If he said them enough, the gods were sure to hear. Ours by blood right, taken from us by treachery, but ours still, ours forever. You do not steal from the dragon, oh, no. The dragon remembers.
  And perhaps the dragon did remember, but Dany could not. She had never seen this land her brother said was theirs, this realm beyond the narrow sea. These places he talked of, Casterly Rock and the Eyrie, Highgarden and the Vale of Arryn, Dorne and the Isle of Faces, they were just words to her. Viserys had been a boy of eight when they fled Kings Landing to escape the advancing armies of the Usurper, but Daenerys had been only a quickening in their mothers womb.
  Yet sometimes Dany would picture the way it had been, so often had her brother told her the stories. The midnight flight to Dragonstone, moonlight shimmering on the ships black sails. Her brother Rhaegar battling the Usurper in the bloody waters of the Trident and dying for the woman he loved. The sack of Kings Landing by the ones Viserys called the Usurpers dogs, the lords Lannister and Stark. Princess Elia of Dorne pleading for mercy as Rhaegars heir was ripped from her breast and murdered before her eyes. The polished skulls of the last dragons staring down sightlessly from the walls of the throne room while the Kingslayer opened Fathers throat with a golden sword.
  She had been born on Dragonstone nine moons after their flight, while a raging summer storm threatened to rip the island fastness apart. They said that storm was terrible. The Targaryen fleet was smashed while it lay at anchor, and huge stone blocks were ripped from the parapets and sent hurtling into the wild waters of the narrow sea. Her mother had died birthing her, and for that her brother Viserys had never forgiven her.
  She did not remember Dragonstone either. They had run again, just before the Usurpers brother set sail with his new-built fleet. By then only Dragonstone itself, the ancient seat of their House, had remained of the Seven Kingdoms that had once been theirs. It would not remain for long. The garrison had been prepared to sell them to the Usurper, but one night Ser Willem Darry and four loyal men had broken into the nursery and stolen them both, along with her wet nurse, and set sail under cover of darkness for the safety of the Braavosian coast.
  She remembered Ser Willem dimly, a great grey bear of a man, half-blind, roaring and bellowing orders from his sickbed. The servants had lived in terror of him, but he had always been kind to Dany. He called her Little Princess and sometimes My Lady, and his hands were soft as old leather. He never left his bed, though, and the smell of sickness clung to him day and night, a hot, moist, sickly sweet odor. That was when they lived in Braavos, in the big house with the red door. Dany had her own room there, with a lemon tree outside her window. After Ser Willem had died, the servants had stolen what little money they had left, and soon after they had been put out of the big house. Dany had cried when the red door closed behind them forever.
  They had wandered since then, from Braavos to Myr, from Myr to Tyrosh, and on to Qohor and Volantis and Lys, never staying long in any one place. Her brother would not allow it. The Usurpers hired knives were close behind them, he insisted, though Dany had never seen one.
  At first the magisters and archons and merchant princes were pleased to welcome the last Targaryens to their homes and tables, but as the years passed and the Usurper continued to sit upon the Iron Throne, doors closed and their lives grew meaner. Years past they had been forced to sell their last few treasures, and now even the coin they had gotten from Mothers crown had gone. In the alleys and wine sinks of Pentos, they called her brother the beggar king. Dany did not want to know what they called her.
  We will have it all back someday, sweet sister, he would promise her. Sometimes his hands shook when he talked about it. The jewels and the silks, Dragonstone and Kings Landing, the Iron Throne and the Seven Kingdoms, all they have taken from us, we will have it back. Viserys lived for that day. All that Daenerys wanted back was the big house with the red door, the lemon tree outside her window, the childhood she had never known.
  There came a soft knock on her door. Come, Dany said, turning away from the window. Illyrios servants entered, bowed, and set about their business. They were slaves, a gift from one of the magisters many Dothraki friends. There was no slavery in the free city of Pentos. Nonetheless, they were slaves. The old woman, small and grey as a mouse, never said a word, but the girl made up for it. She was Illyrios favorite, a fair-haired, blue-eyed wench of sixteen who chattered constantly as she worked.
  They filled her bath with hot water brought up from the kitchen and scented it with fragrant oils. The girl pulled the rough cotton tunic over Danys head and helped her into the tub. The water was scalding hot, but Daenerys did not flinch or cry out. She liked the heat. It made her feel clean. Besides, her brother had often told her that it was never too hot for a Targaryen. Ours is the house of the dragon, he would say. The fire is in our blood.
  The old woman washed her long, silver-pale hair and gently combed out the snags, all in silence. The girl scrubbed her back and her feet and told her how lucky she was. Drogo is so rich that even his slaves wear golden collars. A hundred thousand men ride in his khalasar, and his palace in Vaes Dothrak has two hundred rooms and doors of solid silver. There was more like that, so much more, what a handsome man the khal was, so tall and fierce, fearless in battle, the best rider ever to mount a horse, a demon archer. Daenerys said nothing. She had always assumed that she would wed Viserys when she came of age. For centuries the Targaryens had married brother to sister, since Aegon the Conqueror had taken his sisters to bride. The line must be kept pure, Viserys had told her a thousand times; theirs was the kingsblood, the golden blood of old Valyria, the blood of the dragon. Dragons did not mate with the beasts of the field, and Targaryens did not mingle their blood with that of lesser men. Yet now Viserys schemed to sell her to a stranger, a barbarian.
  When she was clean, the slaves helped her from the water and toweled her dry. The girl brushed her hair until it shone like molten silver, while the old woman anointed her with the spiceflower perfume of the Dothraki plains, a dab on each wrist, behind her ears, on the tips of her breasts, and one last one, cool on her lips, down there between her legs. They dressed her in the wisps that Magister Illyrio had sent up, and then the gown, a deep plum silk to bring out the violet in her eyes. The girl slid the gilded sandals onto her feet, while the old woman fixed the tiara in her hair, and slid golden bracelets crusted with amethysts around her wrists. Last of all came the collar, a heavy golden torc emblazoned with ancient Valyrian glyphs.
  Now you look all a princess, the girl said breathlessly when they were done. Dany glanced at her image in the silvered looking glass that Illyrio had so thoughtfully provided. A princess, she thought, but she remembered what the girl had said, how Khal Drogo was so rich even his slaves wore golden collars. She felt a sudden chill, and gooseflesh pimpled her bare arms.
  Her brother was waiting in the cool of the entry hall, seated on the edge of the pool, his hand trailing in the water. He rose when she appeared and looked her over critically. Stand there, he told her. Turn around. Yes. Good. You look
  Regal, Magister Illyrio said, stepping through an archway. He moved with surprising delicacy for such a massive man. Beneath loose garments of flame-colored silk, rolls of fat jiggled as he walked. Gemstones glittered on every finger, and his man had oiled his forked yellow beard until it shone like real gold. May the Lord of Light shower you with blessings on this most fortunate day, Princess Daenerys, the magister said as he took her hand. He bowed his head, showing a thin glimpse of crooked yellow teeth through the gold of his beard. She is a vision, Your Grace, a vision, he told her brother. Drogo will be enraptured.
  Shes too skinny, Viserys said. His hair, the same silver-blond as hers, had been pulled back tightly behind his head and fastened with a dragonbone brooch. It was a severe look that emphasized the hard, gaunt lines of his face. He rested his hand on the hilt of the sword that Illyrio had lent him, and said, Are you sure that Khal Drogo likes his women this young?
  She has had her blood. She is old enough for the khal, Illyrio told him, not for the first time. Look at her. That silver-gold hair, those purple eyes she is the blood of old Valyria, no doubt, no doubt and highborn, daughter of the old king, sister to the new, she cannot fail to entrance our Drogo. When he released her hand, Daenerys found herself trembling.
  I suppose, her brother said doubtfully. The savages have queer tastes. Boys, horses, sheep
  Best not suggest this to Khal Drogo, Illyrio said.
  Anger flashed in her brothers lilac eyes. Do you take me for a fool?
  The magister bowed slightly. I take you for a king. Kings lack the caution of common men. My apologies if I have given offense. He turned away and clapped his hands for his bearers.
  The streets of Pentos were pitch-dark when they set out in Illyrios elaborately carved palanquin. Two servants went ahead to light their way, carrying ornate oil lanterns with panes of pale blue glass, while a dozen strong men hoisted the poles to their shoulders. It was warm and close inside behind the curtains. Dany could smell the stench of Illyrios pallid flesh through his heavy perfumes.
  Her brother, sprawled out on his pillows beside her, never noticed. His mind was away across the narrow sea. We wont need his whole khalasar, Viserys said. His fingers toyed with the hilt of his borrowed blade, though Dany knew he had never used a sword in earnest. Ten thousand, that would be enough, I could sweep the Seven Kingdoms with ten thousand Dothraki screamers. The realm will rise for its rightful king. Tyrell, Redwyne, Darry, Greyjoy, they have no more love for the Usurper than I do. The Dornishmen burn to avenge Elia and her children. And the smallfolk will be with us. They cry out for their king. He looked at Illyrio anxiously. They do, dont they?
  They are your people, and they love you well, Magister Illyrio said amiably. In holdfasts all across the realm, men lift secret toasts to your health while women sew dragon banners and hide them against the day of your return from across the water. He gave a massive shrug. Or so my agents tell me.
  Dany had no agents, no way of knowing what anyone was doing or thinking across the narrow sea, but she mistrusted Illyrios sweet words as she mistrusted everything about Illyrio. Her brother was nodding eagerly, however. I shall kill the Usurper myself, he promised, who had never killed anyone, as he killed my brother Rhaegar. And Lannister too, the Kingslayer, for what he did to my father.
