That had been a great scandal too. Sansa, of course, had named her pup Lady. Arya made a face and hugged the wolfling tight. Nymeria licked her ear, and she giggled.
  By now Septa Mordane would certainly have sent word to her lady mother. If she went to her room, they would find her. Arya did not care to be found. She had a better notion. The boys were at practice in the yard. She wanted to see Robb put gallant Prince Joffrey flat on his back. Come, she whispered to Nymeria. She got up and ran, the wolf coming hard at her heels.
  There was a window in the covered bridge between the armory and the Great Keep where you had a view of the whole yard. That was where they headed.
  They arrived, flushed and breathless, to find Jon seated on the sill, one leg drawn up languidly to his chin. He was watching the action, so absorbed that he seemed unaware of her approach until his white wolf moved to meet them. Nymeria stalked closer on wary feet. Ghost, already larger than his litter mates, smelled her, gave her ear a careful nip, and settled back down.
  Jon gave her a curious look. Shouldnt you be working on your stitches, little sister?
  Arya made a face at him. I wanted to see them fight.
  He smiled. Come here, then.
  Arya climbed up on the window and sat beside him, to a chorus of thuds and grunts from the yard below.
  To her disappointment, it was the younger boys drilling. Bran was so heavily padded he looked as though he had belted on a featherbed, and Prince Tommen, who was plump to begin with, seemed positively round. They were huffing and puffing and hitting at each other with padded wooden swords under the watchful eye of old Ser Rodrik Cassel, the master-at-arms, a great stout keg of a man with magnificent white cheek whiskers. A dozen spectators, man and boy, were calling out encouragement, Robbs voice the loudest among them. She spotted Theon Greyjoy beside him, his black doublet emblazoned with the golden kraken of his House, a look of wry contempt on his face. Both of the combatants were staggering. Arya judged that they had been at it awhile.
  A shade more exhausting than needlework, Jon observed.
  A shade more fun than needlework, Arya gave back at him. Jon grinned, reached over, and messed up her hair. Arya flushed. They had always been close. Jon had their fathers face, as she did. They were the only ones. Robb and Sansa and Bran and even little Rickon all took after the Tullys, with easy smiles and fire in their hair. When Arya had been little, she had been afraid that meant that she was a bastard too. It been Jon she had gone to in her fear, and Jon who had reassured her.
  Why arent you down in the yard? Arya asked him.
  He gave her a half smile. Bastards are not allowed to damage young princes, he said. Any bruises they take in the practice yard must come from trueborn swords.
  Oh. Arya felt abashed. She should have realized. For the second time today, Arya reflected that life was not fair.
  She watched her little brother whack at Tommen. I could do just as good as Bran, she said. Hes only seven. Im nine.
  Jon looked her over with all his fourteen-year-old wisdom. Youre too skinny, he said. He took her arm to feel her muscle. Then he sighed and shook his head. I doubt you could even lift a longsword, little sister, never mind swing one.
  Arya snatched back her arm and glared at him. Jon messed up her hair again. They watched Bran and Tommen circle each other.
  You see Prince Joffrey? Jon asked.
  She hadnt, not at first glance, but when she looked again she found him to the back, under the shade of the high stone wall. He was surrounded by men she did not recognize, young squires in the livery of Lannister and Baratheon, strangers all. There were a few older men among them; knights, she surmised.
  Look at the arms on his surcoat, Jon suggested.
  Arya looked. An ornate shield had been embroidered on the princes padded surcoat. No doubt the needlework was exquisite. The arms were divided down the middle; on one side was the crowned stag of the royal House, on the other the lion of Lannister.
  The Lannisters are proud, Jon observed. Youd think the royal sigil would be sufficient, but no. He makes his mothers House equal in honor to the kings.
  The woman is important too! Arya protested.
  Jon chuckled. Perhaps you should do the same thing, little sister. Wed Tully to Stark in your arms.
  A wolf with a fish in its mouth? It made her laugh. That would look silly. Besides, if a girl cant fight, why should she have a coat of arms?
  Jon shrugged. Girls get the arms but not the swords. Bastards get the swords but not the arms. I did not make the rules, little sister.
  There was a shout from the courtyard below. Prince Tommen was rolling in the dust, trying to get up and failing. All the padding made him look like a turtle on its back. Bran was standing over him with upraised wooden sword, ready to whack him again once he regained his feet. The men began to laugh.
  Enough! Ser Rodrik called out. He gave the prince a hand and yanked him back to his feet. Well fought. Lew, Donnis, help them out of their armor. He looked around. Prince Joffrey, Robb, will you go another round?
  Robb, already sweaty from a previous bout, moved forward eagerly. Gladly.
  Joffrey moved into the sunlight in response to Rodriks summons. His hair shone like spun gold. He looked bored. This is a game for children, Ser Rodrik.
  Theon Greyjoy gave a sudden bark of laughter. You are children, he said derisively.
  Robb may be a child, Joffrey said. I am a prince. And I grow tired of swatting at Starks with a play sword.
  You got more swats than you gave, Joff, Robb said. Are you afraid?
  Prince Joffrey looked at him. Oh, terrified, he said. Youre so much older. Some of the Lannister men laughed.
  Jon looked down on the scene with a frown. Joffrey is truly a little shit, he told Arya.
  Ser Rodrik tugged thoughtfully at his white whiskers. What are you suggesting? he asked the prince.
  Live steel.
  Done, Robb shot back. Youll be sorry!
  The master-at-arms put a hand on Robbs shoulder to quiet him. Live steel is too dangerous. I will permit you tourney swords, with blunted edges.
  Joffrey said nothing, but a man strange to Arya, a tall knight with black hair and burn scars on his face, pushed forward in front of the prince. This is your prince. Who are you to tell him he may not have an edge on his sword, ser?
  Master-at-arms of Winterfell, Clegane, and you would do well not to forget it.
  Are you training women here? the burned man wanted to know. He was muscled like a bull.
  I am training knights, Ser Rodrik said pointedly. They will have steel when they are ready. When they are of an age.
  The burned man looked at Robb. How old are you, boy?
  Fourteen, Robb said.
  I killed a man at twelve. You can be sure it was not with a blunt sword.
  Arya could see Robb bristle. His pride was wounded. He turned on Ser Rodrik. Let me do it. I can beat him.
  Beat him with a tourney blade, then, Ser Rodrik said.
  Joffrey shrugged. Come and see me when youre older, Stark. If youre not too old. There was laughter from the Lannister men.
  Robbs curses rang through the yard. Arya covered her mouth in shock. Theon Greyjoy seized Robbs arm to keep him away from the prince. Ser Rodrik tugged at his whiskers in dismay.
  Joffrey feigned a yawn and turned to his younger brother. Come, Tommen, he said. The hour of play is done. Leave the children to their frolics.
  That brought more laughter from the Lannisters, more curses from Robb. Ser Rodriks face was beet-red with fury under the white of his whiskers. Theon kept Robb locked in an iron grip until the princes and their party were safely away.
  Jon watched them leave, and Arya watched Jon. His face had grown as still as the pool at the heart of the godswood. Finally he climbed down off the window. The show is done, he said. He bent to scratch Ghost behind the ears. The white wolf rose and rubbed against him. You had best run back to your room, little sister. Septa Mordane will surely be lurking. The longer you hide, the sterner the penance. Youll be sewing all through winter. When the spring thaw comes, they will find your body with a needle still locked tight between your frozen fingers.
  Arya didnt think it was funny. I hate needlework! she said with passion. Its not fair!
  Nothing is fair, Jon said. He messed up her hair again and walked away from her, Ghost moving silently beside him. Nymeria started to follow too, then stopped and came back when she saw that Arya was not coming.
  Reluctantly she turned in the other direction.
  It was worse than Jon had thought. It wasnt Septa Mordane waiting in her room. It was Septa Mordane and her mother.
 Bran
  The hunt left at dawn. The king wanted wild boar at the feast tonight. Prince Joffrey rode with his father, so Robb had been allowed to join the hunters as well. Uncle Benjen, Jory, Theon Greyjoy, Ser Rodrik, and even the queens funny little brother had all ridden out with them. It was the last hunt, after all. On the morrow they left for the south.
  Bran had been left behind with Jon and the girls and Rickon. But Rickon was only a baby and the girls were only girls and Jon and his wolf were nowhere to be found. Bran did not look for him very hard. He thought Jon was angry at him. Jon seemed to be angry at everyone these days. Bran did not know why. He was going with Uncle Ben to the Wall, to join the Nights Watch. That was almost as good as going south with the king. Robb was the one they were leaving behind, not Jon.
  For days, Bran could scarcely wait to be off. He was going to ride the kingsroad on a horse of his own, not a pony but a real horse. His father would be the Hand of the King, and they were going to live in the red castle at Kings Landing, the castle the Dragonlords had built. Old Nan said there were ghosts there, and dungeons where terrible things had been done, and dragon heads on the walls. It gave Bran a shiver just to think of it, but he was not afraid. How could he be afraid? His father would be with him, and the king with all his knights and sworn swords.
  Bran was going to be a knight himself someday, one of the Kingsguard. Old Nan said they were the finest swords in all the realm. There were only seven of them, and they wore white armor and had no wives or children, but lived only to serve the king. Bran knew all the stories. Their names were like music to him. Serwyn of the Mirror Shield. Ser Ryam Redwyne. Prince Aemon the Dragonknight. The twins Ser Erryk and Ser Arryk, who had died on one anothers swords hundreds of years ago, when brother fought sister in the war the singers called the Dance of the Dragons. The White Bull, Gerold Hightower. Ser Arthur Dayne, the Sword of the Morning. Barristan the Bold.
  Two of the Kingsguard had come north with King Robert. Bran had watched them with fascination, never quite daring to speak to them. Ser Boros was a bald man with a jowly face, and Ser Meryn had droopy eyes and a beard the color of rust. Ser Jaime Lannister looked more like the knights in the stories, and he was of the Kingsguard too, but Robb said he had killed the old mad king and shouldnt count anymore. The greatest living knight was Ser Barristan Selmy, Barristan the Bold, the Lord Commander of the Kingsguard. Father had promised that they would meet Ser Barristan when they reached Kings Landing, and Bran had been marking the days on his wall, eager to depart, to see a world he had only dreamed of and begin a life he could scarcely imagine.
  Yet now that the last day was at hand, suddenly Bran felt lost. Winterfell had been the only home he had ever known. His father had told him that he ought to say his farewells today, and he had tried. After the hunt had ridden out, he wandered through the castle with his wolf at his side, intending to visit the ones who would be left behind, Old Nan and Gage the cook, Mikken in his smithy, Hodor the stableboy who smiled so much and took care of his pony and never said anything but Hodor, the man in the glass gardens who gave him a blackberry when he came to visit
  But it was no good. He had gone to the stable first, and seen his pony there in its stall, except it wasnt his pony anymore, he was getting a real horse and leaving the pony behind, and all of a sudden Bran just wanted to sit down and cry. He turned and ran off before Hodor and the other stableboys could see the tears in his eyes. That was the end of his farewells. Instead Bran spent the morning alone in the godswood, trying to teach his wolf to fetch a stick, and failing. The wolfling was smarter than any of the hounds in his fathers kennel and Bran would have sworn he understood every word that was said to him, but he showed very little interest in chasing sticks.
  He was still trying to decide on a name. Robb was calling his Grey Wind, because he ran so fast. Sansa had named hers Lady, and Arya named hers after some old witch queen in the songs, and little Rickon called his Shaggydog, which Bran thought was a pretty stupid name for a direwolf. Jons wolf, the white one, was Ghost. Bran wished he had thought of that first, even though his wolf wasnt white. He had tried a hundred names in the last fortnight, but none of them sounded right.
  Finally he got tired of the stick game and decided to go climbing. He hadnt been up to the broken tower for weeks with everything that had happened, and this might be his last chance.
  He raced across the godswood, taking the long way around to avoid the pool where the heart tree grew. The heart tree had always frightened him; trees ought not have eyes, Bran thought, or leaves that looked like hands. His wolf came sprinting at his heels. You stay here, he told him at the base of the sentinel tree near the armory wall. Lie down. Thats right. Now stay
  The wolf did as he was told. Bran scratched him behind the ears, then turned away, jumped, grabbed a low branch, and pulled himself up. He was halfway up the tree, moving easily from limb to limb, when the wolf got to his feet and began to howl.
  Bran looked back down. His wolf fell silent, staring up at him through slitted yellow eyes. A strange chill went through him. He began to climb again. Once more the wolf howled. Quiet, he yelled. Sit down. Stay. Youre worse than Mother. The howling chased him all the way up the tree, until finally he jumped off onto the armory roof and out of sight.
  The rooftops of Winterfell were Brans second home. His mother often said that Bran could climb before he could walk. Bran could not remember when he first learned to walk, but he could not remember when he started to climb either, so he supposed it must be true.
  To a boy, Winterfell was a grey stone labyrinth of walls and towers and courtyards and tunnels spreading out in all directions. In the older parts of the castle, the halls slanted up and down so that you couldnt even be sure what floor you were on. The place had grown over the centuries like some monstrous stone tree, Maester Luwin told him once, and its branches were gnarled and thick and twisted, its roots sunk deep into the earth.
  When he got out from under it and scrambled up near the sky, Bran could see all of Winterfell in a glance. He liked the way it looked, spread out beneath him, only birds wheeling over his head while all the life of the castle went on below. Bran could perch for hours among the shapeless, rain-worn gargoyles that brooded over the First Keep, watching it all: the men drilling with wood and steel in the yard, the cooks tending their vegetables in the glass garden, restless dogs running back and forth in the kennels, the silence of the godswood, the girls gossiping beside the washing well. It made him feel like he was lord of the castle, in a way even Robb would never know.
  It taught him Winterfells secrets too. The builders had not even leveled the earth; there were hills and valleys behind the walls of Winterfell. There was a covered bridge that went from the fourth floor of the bell tower across to the second floor of the rookery. Bran knew about that. And he knew you could get inside the inner wall by the south gate, climb three floors and run all the way around Winterfell through a narrow tunnel in the stone, and then come out on ground level at the north gate, with a hundred feet of wall looming over you. Even Maester Luwin didnt know that, Bran was convinced.
  His mother was terrified that one day Bran would slip off a wall and kill himself. He told her that he wouldnt, but she never believed him. Once she made him promise that he would stay on the ground. He had managed to keep that promise for almost a fortnight, miserable every day, until one night he had gone out the window of his bedroom when his brothers were fast asleep.
  He confessed his crime the next day in a fit of guilt. Lord Eddard ordered him to the godswood to cleanse himself. Guards were posted to see that Bran remained there alone all night to reflect on his disobedience. The next morning Bran was nowhere to be seen. They finally found him fast asleep in the upper branches of the tallest sentinel in the grove.
  As angry as he was, his father could not help but laugh. Youre not my son, he told Bran when they fetched him down, youre a squirrel. So be it. If you must climb, then climb, but try not to let your mother see you.
  Bran did his best, although he did not think he ever really fooled her. Since his father would not forbid it, she turned to others. Old Nan told him a story about a bad little boy who climbed too high and was struck down by lightning, and how afterward the crows came to peck out his eyes. Bran was not impressed. There were crows nests atop the broken tower, where no one ever went but him, and sometimes he filled his pockets with corn before he climbed up there and the crows ate it right out of his hand. None of them had ever shown the slightest bit of interest in pecking out his eyes.
  Later, Maester Luwin built a little pottery boy and dressed him in Brans clothes and flung him off the wall into the yard below, to demonstrate what would happen to Bran if he fell. That had been fun, but afterward Bran just looked at the maester and said, Im not made of clay. And anyhow, I never fall.
  Then for a while the guards would chase him whenever they saw him on the roofs, and try to haul him down. That was the best time of all. It was like playing a game with his brothers, except that Bran always won. None of the guards could climb half so well as Bran, not even Jory. Most of the time they never saw him anyway. People never looked up. That was another thing he liked about climbing; it was almost like being invisible.
  He liked how it felt too, pulling himself up a wall stone by stone, fingers and toes digging hard into the small crevices between. He always took off his boots and went barefoot when he climbed; it made him feel as if he had four hands instead of two. He liked the deep, sweet ache it left in the muscles afterward. He liked the way the air tasted way up high, sweet and cold as a winter peach. He liked the birds: the crows in the broken tower, the tiny little sparrows that nested in cracks between the stones, the ancient owl that slept in the dusty loft above the old armory. Bran knew them all.
  Most of all, he liked going places that no one else could go, and seeing the grey sprawl of Winterfell in a way that no one else ever saw it. It made the whole castle Brans secret place.
  His favorite haunt was the broken tower. Once it had been a watchtower, the tallest in Winterfell. A long time ago, a hundred years before even his father had been born, a lightning strike had set it afire. The top third of the structure had collapsed inward, and the tower had never been rebuilt. Sometimes his father sent ratters into the base of the tower, to clean out the nests they always found among the jumble of fallen stones and charred and rotten beams. But no one ever got up to the jagged top of the structure now except for Bran and the crows.
  He knew two ways to get there. You could climb straight up the side of the tower itself, but the stones were loose, the mortar that held them together long gone to ash, and Bran never liked to put his full weight on them.
  The best way was to start from the godswood, shinny up the tall sentinel, and cross over the armory and the guards hall, leaping roof to roof, barefoot so the guards wouldnt hear you overhead. That brought you up to the blind side of the First Keep, the oldest part of the castle, a squat round fortress that was taller than it looked. Only rats and spiders lived there now but the old stones still made for good climbing. You could go straight up to where the gargoyles leaned out blindly over empty space, and swing from gargoyle to gargoyle, hand over hand, around to the north side. From there, if you really stretched, you could reach out and pull yourself over to the broken tower where it leaned close. The last part was the scramble up the blackened stones to the eyrie, no more than ten feet, and then the crows would come round to see if youd brought any corn.
  Bran was moving from gargoyle to gargoyle with the ease of long practice when he heard the voices. He was so startled he almost lost his grip. The First Keep had been empty all his life.
  I do not like it, a woman was saying. There was a row of windows beneath him, and the voice was drifting out of the last window on this side. You should be the Hand.
  Gods forbid, a mans voice replied lazily. Its not an honor Id want. Theres far too much work involved.
  Bran hung, listening, suddenly afraid to go on. They might glimpse his feet if he tried to swing by.
  Dont you see the danger this puts us in? the woman said. Robert loves the man like a brother.
  Robert can barely stomach his brothers. Not that I blame him. Stannis would be enough to give anyone indigestion.
  Dont play the fool. Stannis and Renly are one thing, and Eddard Stark is quite another. Robert will listen to Stark. Damn them both. I should have insisted that he name you, but I was certain Stark would refuse him.
  We ought to count ourselves fortunate, the man said. The king might as easily have named one of his brothers, or even Littlefinger, gods help us. Give me honorable enemies rather than ambitious ones, and Ill sleep more easily by night.
  They were talking about Father, Bran realized. He wanted to hear more. A few more feet but they would see him if he swung out in front of the window.
  We will have to watch him carefully, the woman said.
  I would sooner watch you, the man said. He sounded bored. Come back here.
  Lord Eddard has never taken any interest in anything that happened south of the Neck, the woman said. Never. I tell you, he means to move against us. Why else would he leave the seat of his power?
  A hundred reasons. Duty. Honor. He yearns to write his name large across the book of history, to get away from his wife, or both. Perhaps he just wants to be warm for once in his life.
  His wife is Lady Arryns sister. Its a wonder Lysa was not here to greet us with her accusations.
  Bran looked down. There was a narrow ledge beneath the window, only a few inches wide. He tried to lower himself toward it. Too far. He would never reach.
  You fret too much. Lysa Arryn is a frightened cow.
  That frightened cow shared Jon Arryns bed.
  If she knew anything, she would have gone to Robert before she fled Kings Landing.
  When he had already agreed to foster that weakling son of hers at Casterly Rock? I think not. She knew the boys life would be hostage to her silence. She may grow bolder now that hes safe atop the Eyrie.
  Mothers. The man made the word sound like a curse. I think birthing does something to your minds. You are all mad. He laughed. It was a bitter sound. Let Lady Arryn grow as bold as she likes. Whatever she knows, whatever she thinks she knows, she has no proof. He paused a moment. Or does she?
  Do you think the king will require proof? the woman said. I tell you, he loves me not.
  And whose fault is that, sweet sister?
  Bran studied the ledge. He could drop down. It was too narrow to land on, but if he could catch hold as he fell past, pull himself up except that might make a noise, draw them to the window. He was not sure what he was hearing, but he knew it was not meant for his ears.
  You are as blind as Robert, the woman was saying.
  If you mean I see the same thing, yes, the man said. I see a man who would sooner die than betray his king.
  He betrayed one already, or have you forgotten? the woman said. Oh, I dont deny hes loyal to Robert, thats obvious. What happens when Robert dies and Joff takes the throne? And the sooner that comes to pass, the safer well all be. My husband grows more restless every day. Having Stark beside him will only make him worse. Hes still in love with the sister, the insipid little dead sixteen-year-old. How long till he decides to put me aside for some new Lyanna?
  Bran was suddenly very frightened. He wanted nothing so much as to go back the way he had come, to find his brothers. Only what would he tell them? He had to get closer, Bran realized. He had to see who was talking.
  The man sighed. You should think less about the future and more about the pleasures at hand.
  Stop that! the woman said. Bran heard the sudden slap of flesh on flesh, then the mans laughter.
  Bran pulled himself up, climbed over the gargoyle, crawled out onto the roof. This was the easy way. He moved across the roof to the next gargoyle, right above the window of the room where they were talking.
  All this talk is getting very tiresome, sister, the man said. Come here and be quiet.
  Bran sat astride the gargoyle, tightened his legs around it, and swung himself around, upside down. He hung by his legs and slowly stretched his head down toward the window. The world looked strange upside down. A courtyard swam dizzily below him, its stones still wet with melted snow.
  Bran looked in the window.
  Inside the room, a man and a woman were wrestling. They were both naked. Bran could not tell who they were. The mans back was to him, and his body screened the woman from view as he pushed her up against a wall.
  There were soft, wet sounds. Bran realized they were kissing. He watched, wide-eyed and frightened, his breath tight in his throat. The man had a hand down between her legs, and he must have been hurting her there, because the woman started to moan, low in her throat. Stop it, she said, stop it, stop it. Oh, please But her voice was low and weak, and she did not push him away. Her hands buried themselves in his hair, his tangled golden hair, and pulled his face down to her breast.
  Bran saw her face. Her eyes were closed and her mouth was open, moaning. Her golden hair swung from side to side as her head moved back and forth, but still he recognized the queen.
  He must have made a noise. Suddenly her eyes opened, and she was staring right at him. She screamed.
  Everything happened at once then.  The woman pushed the man away wildly, shouting and pointing. Bran tried to pull himself up, bending double as he reached for the gargoyle. He was in too much of a hurry. His hand scraped uselessly across smooth stone, and in his panic his legs slipped, and suddenly he was failing. There was an instant of vertigo, a sickening lurch as the window flashed past. He shot out a hand, grabbed for the ledge, lost it, caught it again with his other hand. He swung against the building, hard. The impact took the breath out of him. Bran dangled, one-handed, panting.
  Faces appeared in the window above him.
  The queen. And now Bran recognized the man beside her. They looked as much alike as reflections in a mirror.
  He saw us, the woman said shrilly.
  So he did, the man said.
  Brans fingers started to slip. He grabbed the ledge with his other hand. Fingernails dug into unyielding stone. The man reached down. Take my hand, he said. Before you fall.
  Bran seized his arm and held on tight with all his strength. The man yanked him up to the ledge. What are you doing? the woman demanded.
  The man ignored her. He was very strong. He stood Bran up on the sill. How old are you, boy?
  Seven, Bran said, shaking with relief. His fingers had dug deep gouges in the mans forearm. He let go sheepishly.
  The man looked over at the woman. The things I do for love, he said with loathing. He gave Bran a shove.
  Screaming, Bran went backward out the window into empty air. There was nothing to grab on to. The courtyard rushed up to meet him.
  Somewhere off in the distance, a wolf was howling. Crows circled the broken tower, waiting for corn.
 Tyrion
  Somewhere in the great stone maze of Winterfell, a wolf howled. The sound hung over the castle like a flag of mourning.
  Tyrion Lannister looked up from his books and shivered, though the library was snug and warm. Something about the howling of a wolf took a man right out of his here and now and left him in a dark forest of the mind, running naked before the pack.
  When the direwolf howled again, Tyrion shut the heavy leatherbound cover on the book he was reading, a hundred-year-old discourse on the changing of the seasons by a long-dead maester. He covered a yawn with the back of his hand. His reading lamp was flickering, its oil all but gone, as dawn light leaked through the high windows. He had been at it all night, but that was nothing new. Tyrion Lannister was not much a one for sleeping.
  His legs were stiff and sore as he eased down off the bench. He massaged some life back into them and limped heavily to the table where the septon was snoring softly, his head pillowed on an open book in front of him. Tyrion glanced at the title. A life of the Grand Maester Aethelmure, no wonder. Chayle, he said softly. The young man jerked up, blinking, confused, the crystal of his order swinging wildly on its silver chain. Im off to break my fast. See that you return the books to the shelves. Be gentle with the Valyrian scrolls, the parchment is very dry. Ayrmidons Engines of War is quite rare, and yours is the only complete copy Ive ever seen. Chayle gaped at him, still half-asleep. Patiently, Tyrion repeated his instructions, then clapped the septon on the shoulder and left him to his tasks.
  Outside, Tyrion swallowed a lungful of the cold morning air and began his laborious descent of the steep stone steps that corkscrewed around the exterior of the library tower. It was slow going; the steps were cut high and narrow, while his legs were short and twisted. The rising sun had not yet cleared the walls of Winterfell, but the men were already hard at it in the yard below. Sandor Cleganes rasping voice drifted up to him. The boy is a long time dying. I wish he would be quicker about it.
  Tyrion glanced down and saw the Hound standing with young Joffrey as squires swarmed around them. At least he dies quietly, the prince replied. Its the wolf that makes the noise. I could scarce sleep last night.
